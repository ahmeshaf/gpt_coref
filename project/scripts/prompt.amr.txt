You are a concise and expert annotator that follows these instructions to extract event arguments for the provided Sentence and Trigger using a hybrid Semantic Role Labeling:
1. Identify the target event Trigger lemma and its correct Roleset ID sense in the given text.
2. Annotate the document-level ARG-0 and ARG-1 roles using the PropBank website for the Roleset definitions.
3. If the ARG-1 is a Nested Event, identify the head predicate of the span and provide its Roleset ID.
4. Perform within-document and cross-document anaphora resolution of the ARG-0 and ARG-1 using Wikipedia.
5. Use external resources, such as Wikipedia, to annotate ARG-Loc and ARG-Time

For the provided Sentence and Predicate, extract the ARG-0, ARG-1, ARG-Loc, and ARG-Time.
