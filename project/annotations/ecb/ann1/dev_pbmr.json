  "marked_doc": "The Indian navy captured 23 pirates who threatened a merchant vessel in the lawless waters of the Gulf of Aden and a German naval helicopter thwarted another attack Saturday on a freighter being <mark id=\"mark_id\"> chased </mark> by speedboats off Yemen .\nThe successes came days before Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was to ask the United Nations to authorize `` all necessary measures '' against increasingly bold Somalian pirates operating in one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes .\nAn Indian navy ship , the INS Mysore , was escorting merchant ships in waters off Somalia 's coast Saturday when it received a distress call from seamen on board the MV Gibe , who said they were being fired on by two boats that were approaching fast .\nThe Mysore and its helicopter sped to the scene , and the pirate boats attempted to escape when they saw them , according to a statement from the Indian government .\nIndian marine commandoes boarded the pirate boats and seized `` a substantial cache of arms and equipment , '' including seven AK-47 assault rifles , three machine guns , a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and other weapons , the statement said .\nThey also found a GPS receiver and other equipment .\nThe pirates were from Somalia and Yemen , two countries on the coast of the Gulf of Aden .\nThe Gibe was flying an Ethiopian flag but little else was known about it , the Indian statement said .\nLast month , India 's navy drew criticism after sinking a Thai fishing trawler that had been commandeered hours earlier by pirates .\nAt least one Thai crew member was killed in the attack , which the Indian navy had originally announced by saying it had sunk a pirate `` mother ship . ''\nThe Indian navy defended its actions , saying it had fired in self-defense .\nSomali pirates have become increasingly brazen and recently seized a Saudi supertanker loaded with $ 100 million of crude oil .\nMany of the vessels are taken to pirate-controlled regions in Somalia , where they are held for ransom .\nIt was not immediately clear what would happen to the pirates captured by the Indians , or where they would be taken .\nThe statement said only that the prisoners and their weapons would be `` handed over to appropriate authorities ashore . ''\nMost foreign navies patrolling the Somali coast have been reluctant to detain suspects because of uncertainties over where they would face trial , since Somalia has no effective central government or legal system .\nAlso on Saturday , a German military spokesman said a navy frigate had chased away pirates in speedboats pursuing an Ethiopian freighter off the coast of Yemen .\nThe German frigate responded to a distress call from the freighter , and a helicopter took off from the deck to investigate .\nThe pirates turned away from the freighter as the helicopter flew overhead , said the spokesman , who declined to give his name in line with military policy .\nAn estimated 1,500 pirates are based in Somalia 's semiautonomous Puntland region , raking in millions of dollars .\nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice will present a draft Security Council resolution next week asking the United Nations to authorize `` all necessary measures '' against piracy from Somalia .\nHowever , the commander of the U.S. Navy 's 5th Fleet expressed doubt Friday about the wisdom of launching attacks against Somali pirates on land , as the draft proposes .\nU.S. Vice Adm. Bill Gortney told reporters that it is difficult to identify pirates , and the potential for killing innocent civilians `` can not be overestimated . ''\nThe threat of pirates recently prompted a German cruise ship to evacuate some 420 passengers and crew after the company decided not to risk their safety as the ship passed through the Gulf of Aden .\nThe passengers and crew have rejoined the M/S Columbus - which is on a six-month round-the-world trip - in Oman 's port of Salalah after three days in Dubai , Hamburg-based cruise operator Hapag-Lloyd said Saturday .\nThe ship and a limited crew made it through the gulf without incident , a company spokeswoman said ."

  "marked_doc": "Employees at a Vancouver wholesaler were coping Saturday with the death of their boss , who was gunned down at their office Christmas <mark id=\"mark_id\"> party </mark> .\nA man facing murder charges in a Christmas party shooting was on suicide watch Monday as friends and family of paid glowing tribute to his alleged victim .\nThose who knew Benjamin David Banky , 40 , were still in shock three days after he was gunned down during what was supposed to be a Christmas celebration at his office .\nHis accused killer , Eric Kirkpatrick , made a brief appearance in Vancouver provincial court Monday on a charge of first-degree murder .\nBanky was CEO of TallGrass Distribution Ltd. , a wholesaler of natural health products , which remained closed Monday .\n`` He was incredibly bright , a very caring person and incredibly family-oriented , '' said Nancy O'Higgins , a longtime family friend .\nO'Higgins and her husband Eric , both retired journalists , knew Ben as a baby because they worked in the media in Ontario with Ben 's father Jake before both families moved west , six months apart .\nThe O'Higgins ' attended Ben 's wedding a couple of years ago on Hornby Island , one of the Gulf Islands where his parents now live .\n`` They were n't married very long , just a couple of years . ''\nShe said Ben and his wife grew up as neighbours on Hornby Island .\n`` That was how Ben and Linda knew each other . ''\nBen attended school in his early years in White Rock but got most of his education in Victoria where his father worked for Broadcast News , which is now The Canadian Press .\nShe said he travelled to China for awhile , where he studied Mandarin and was quite fluent .\n`` I was so incredibly impressed that he spoke Mandarin that that really stuck in my head , '' said O'Higgins .\nJohn Banky , Ben 's older brother , spoke briefly from the parents ' home Monday , alluding to his brother 's musical abilities .\n`` He spoke a few languages and could play any instrument made by man , '' said his brother .\nWhile the family tried to deal with the loss , Kirkpatrick made a brief appearance in court .\nHis lawyer , Richard Fowler , told the court his client is on suicide watch at the North Fraser Pretrial Centre in Port Coquitlam .\nFowler described conditions at the centre as unacceptable , saying his client is double-bunked with a man who is withdrawing from a drug addiction and the cell is cold .\nMuch of B.C. is in the grips of a cold spell , with unusually cold temperatures in the Vancouver area that are well below freezing .\nKirkpatrick , who has long grey hair flowing down to his shoulders and a long grey beard , was dressed in red , prison-issue coveralls .\nHe stood quietly in the prisoner 's box listening to the proceedings .\nThe sixty-one-year-old was arrested Friday , not long after Banky was shot to death .\nOutside court , Fowler said Kirkpatrick is `` not doing very well . ''\n`` He is placed in a double bunk with somebody who is withdrawing from drugs .\nHe can not sleep .\nIt 's freezing cold .\nThe problem is that these institutions are too full . ''\n`` He 's presumed innocent and he should be treated better . ''\nLon Wood , another retired Victoria journalist who knew Ben 's father from their days working in Victoria , said he met Ben and the other children through their parents .\n`` They are a very close family . ''\nJohn Paul Fraser of National Public Relations , which is working for TallGrass , said the family is not speaking publicly yet .\nAt a weekend news conference , city police spokesman Const .\nTim Fanning said Kirkpatrick had been let go from TallGrass on Thursday .\nFanning did n't know how long the suspect had worked at the business .\nThe other people at the office party were able to escape without injury , Fanning said .\n`` The shock was tremendous but all the other people in the business - and a dozen other people who were there for a Christmas party - managed to get out safely , '' Fanning said .\nThe shocked party-goers were put on buses and taken to police headquarters where witness statements were taken , he said .\nHe said counsellors have been made available to them ."

  "marked_doc": "A man has been <mark id=\"mark_id\"> charged </mark> with first-degree murder after a shooting at an office Christmas party in Vancouver Friday .\nPolice allege Eric Allen Kirkpatrick , 61 , opened fire at the TallGrass Distribution Ltd Christmas party , killing Benjamin David Banky , 40 .\nBanky was the CEO of TallGrass Distribution Ltd. , a natural health products company .\nAt least a dozen employees had been celebrating when the gunman , who had been recently laid off , entered the party and began firing a gun , according to Vancouver Police spokesperson Const. Tim Fanning .\nThe other partygoers managed to escape unharmed .\n`` The shock was tremendous but all the other people in the business - and there another dozen other people who were there for a Christmas party - managed to get out safely , '' Fanning said .\nPolice locked down the neighbourhood before the suspect turned himself in around 6 p.m .\nPolice said Kirkpatrick was let go on Dec. 11 .\nA resident who lives in a nearby apartment building told The Canadian Press that he did not hear gunshots , but saw a woman run from the party and into a nearby auto repair shop , where it appears she called for help .\n`` All of a sudden in my front yard there were five totally decked out , geared up riot squad officers with guns out of the holster , aiming at the second floor of the building right beside us , '' Luke Pigeon said .\n`` I tried to open up my door and they said close your door , lock your door . ''\nMark Pinder told The Canadian Press that police ordered a group of film studio employees into the basement of their building , which was across the street from the party .\nThe group was just about to celebrate the completion of a project when police came knocking , he said .\n`` People grabbed a couple of bowls of chips and dip and we just sort of moved the party downstairs , '' Pinder said .\n`` Some people seemed quite concerned but there was n't anyone freaking out or crying .\nEveryone was calling their family and making sure that people knew they were OK . ''\nPigeon said police spent about two hours negotiating with the suspect before bringing him into custody .\n`` They cuffed him on the ground and they took him into a cruiser , '' he said .\n`` He was giving them a bit of grief , he was saying that his cuffs hurt , but he was following orders . ''\nEmployees who had been at the party at the time of the shooting are receiving counselling from the Vancouver police victim 's services team .\n`` I can not emphasize enough how traumatic this would have been for the people in there to see one of their co-workers gunned down , so we 're going to do all we can to help these people though a very , very difficult time , '' Fanning said ."

Fanning said .\nWhat followed was a tense two hours while police negotiated with a suspect to give himself up .\nIt 's not known what kind of firearm was involved .\nLuke Pigeon , who lives in an apartment building next door , said he did n't hear a gunshot but was drawn to his window by a commotion outside .\n`` It was n't typical , crazy noise that sometimes happens .\nYou got the feeling there was something definitely , definitely wrong , '' Mr. Pigeon told The Canadian Press .\nHe looked out the window and saw a woman fleeing the building next door .\n`` All I saw was a ... lady running down the block screaming , '' Mr. Pigeon said .\nHe said she ran into the auto repair shop and in what seemed like mere minutes , police were on the scene .\n`` All of a sudden , in my front yard there were five totally decked out , geared up riot squad officers with guns out of the holster , aiming at the second floor of the building right beside us , '' Mr. Pigeon said .\n`` I tried to open up my door and they said 'close your door , lock your door . '' '\nHe spent the next two hours in his apartment , as police negotiated and finally persuaded a suspect to surrender .\n`` They cuffed him on the ground and they took him into a cruiser , '' Mr. Pigeon said .\n`` He was giving them a bit of grief , he was saying that his cuffs hurt , but he was following orders . ''\nMr. Pigeon also commended police for their handling of the dangerous situation .\n`` They managed to stop any further loss of life . ''\nMark Pinder was working at a film studio across the street when a police officer banged at his window .\n`` I did n't realize it was a police officer right away because he was a plainclothes officer , '' Mr. Pinder said .\n`` But then I saw that he had a weapon drawn . ''\nThe officer told Mr. Pinder to get everyone in the basement .\nMr. Pinder and his fellow employees were just about to begin a party to celebrate the completion of a show they 'd been working on .\n`` People grabbed a couple of bowls of chips and dip and we just sort of moved the party downstairs , '' Mr. Pinder said .\n`` Some people seemed quite concerned but there was n't anyone freaking out or crying , '' Mr. Pinder said .\n`` Everyone was calling their family and making sure that people knew that they were okay . ''\nWork place killings are rare , police say .\n`` It 's something no business can prepare for , '' Const. Fanning said ."

''\n`` It 's really important that we come up with a solution , '' he said .\n`` These are unheard-of times , and no one can predict what is going to happen '' with the U.S. economy .\nSAG 'S DARK CLOUD\nThe Oscars , given out by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , are annually Hollywood 's glitziest night .\nPutting the show in jeopardy , however , was this week 's announcement by SAG that strike authorization ballots will be mailed to its 120,000 members on January 2 and tallied on January 23 , a full month before the Oscars .\nThat sequence of events raises the prospect of A-list stars boycotting the honors to avoid crossing their own union 's picket lines -- or even carrying picket signs themselves .\nThe same dynamic came into play last January when a work stoppage by 10,500 Writers Guild of America members threw the awards season into disarray and caused the star-filled Golden Globe Awards to be replaced by a news conference .\nOnly 5.8 million TV viewers tuned-in , far below the Globes ' typical 20 million audience .\nBroadcaster NBC lost an estimated $ 10 million to $ 15 million in advertising revenue .\nThe writers strike was settled a month later , sparing the Academy Awards and its network , ABC , a similar fate .\nBut this time around , the Oscars are on the firing line and Australian actor Jackman , star of the `` X-Men '' movies as well as Broadway stage shows , may himself have to pull out .\n`` At this point , we are moving forward with all of our plans to do our show , and of course we are monitoring what is going on , '' said Academy spokeswoman Leslie Unger .\nSAG leaders say they need a credible strike threat to wrest a better contract deal from the studios than the `` final '' offer management presented before talks collapsed on June 30 .\nThey stress , however , that a `` yes '' vote does not automatically put a strike into effect , and it remains uncertain whether SAG can muster the support it needs -- 75 percent of those voting -- to pass its authorization .\nTalks collapsed over issues that included how much actors would get paid for work on the Internet , and the financial impact of a possible strike on Hollywood remains unclear .\nMost films slated for release in 2009 already have been shot , meaning the 2010 slate would see the brunt of a strike .\nSome TV prime-time dramas and sitcoms will have completed production before SAG a work stoppage , though a walkout could hinder development of new series for Fall 2009 ."

''\nJackman also has award-winning hosting experience:\nHe won an Emmy in 2005 for hosting the 58th annual Tony Awards in 2004 , when he also took a best-actor Tony for his performance in the musical `` The Boy From Oz .\n`` Jackman has never been an Oscar nominee , but was nominated for a Golden Globe for his role in 2001 's romantic film `` Kate and Leopold . ''\nHe also served as a past presenter on the Oscar show .\nJackman and his wife , Deborra-Lee Furness , have their own Oscar at home - their 8-year-old son , Oscar Maximillian .\nThe couple also have a 3-year-old daughter Ava ."

''\nAnd as last season 's mercifully short-lived `` Viva Laughlin '' proved , one talented person does not a television show make .\nOr at least not a good television show .\nBut Mark and Condon are the team that brought us `` Dreamgirls , '' which actually makes Jackman an obvious choice .\nThere 's nothing wrong with a big Broadway-esque opener similar to Billy Crystal 's famous musical clips , but with more hip action .\nBeyond that , however , it gets a little worrisome .\nThe Oscars have a prickly relationship with singin ' and dancin ' and as anyone who saw Rosie O'Donnell 's recent disaster knows , nothing fails bigger than a failed variety show .\nWhat Jackman does have in his favor is an unapologetic , unabashed love for , and understanding of , theater .\nHe is n't snarky and he is n't an outsider .\nHe is a from-the-bottom-of-his-heart performer who seems utterly happy and at ease in front of an audience .\nNo doubt those in the Kodak will enjoy an energetic and dazzling evening .\nHow it will play on television remains to be seen .\nBut maybe it 's time we stopped caring about that so much ."

Collins would do a good job representing NIH in front of lawmakers and others .\nHe is a very approachable person who doesn't rely on jargon to communicate , said Sean B . Tipton , spokesman for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine .\n\"He has an ability to interact with the public and with policymakers and the press that I think will serve him very well as an NIH director . \"\nThe Hastings Center's Murray said that if Dr . Collins ever made a mistake , it may be that he was a bit overly enthusiastic when describing the potential for breakthroughs when he was leading the Human Genome Project .\nStill , \"I can't fault the scientist who really believes in their work for being enthusiastic as they talk to Congress , \" Murray said .\nDr . Collins has garnered attention by professing that his belief in God can coexist with his pursuit of science .\nHe's written books on the topic , including the 2007 best - seller The Language of God : A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief .\nHe is also founder and president of the BioLogos Foundation , whose purpose is to find compatibility between the scientific and religious searches for truth .\nIn an interview with the spiritual Web site Beliefnet in 2007 , Dr . Collins said Christians who reject scientific evolutionary theory are also rejecting humans' ability to understand , a God - given skill .\nBut there are limits to the questions science can answer , such as why we are here or what happens after death , he said .\nWilliam Hurlbut , MD , a consulting professor of neuroscience at Stanford University and a former member of President George W .

  "marked_doc": "http : / / www . amednews . com / article / 20090720 / government / 307209986 / 1 /\nFormer AMA trustee Dr . Benjamin nominated to be surgeon general\nPosted July 20 , 2009\nPresident Obama's choices to be the nation's top physician and top scientist are both hands - on practitioners with extensive leadership experience .\nOn July 13 , Obama announced that he was <mark id=\"mark_id\"> nominating </mark> Regina M . Benjamin , MD , a family physician from southern Alabama , to be surgeon general .\nDr . Benjamin , 52 , became the first woman and first African - American president of the Medical Assn . of the State of Alabama in 2002 .\nShe also completed a term in June as chair of the AMA Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs and served on the AMA Board of Trustees from 1995 to 1998 , becoming the first physician under 40 to serve on the board in a non - resident role .\nOn July 8 , Obama nominated Francis S . Collins , MD , PhD , as director of the National Institutes of Health .\nDr . Collins , 59 , led the Human Genome Project - - an effort to sequence and map human genes , that concluded in 2003 .\nHe left his position as director of the NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute in 2008 after 15 years but maintains a lab at the NIH's Bethesda , Md . , campus .\nBoth nominees must first be confirmed by the Senate .\nAMA President J . James Rohack , MD , said Dr . Benjamin has an impressive list of accomplishments , including receiving a MacArthur Fellowship in 2008 , commonly known as the \"genius grant . \"\nBut awards are not her main focus , he said .\n\"Dr . Benjamin's most important qualification for surgeon general is her deep commitment to her patients . \"\nDr . Benjamin said in the White House Rose Garden announcement that the deaths of close relatives from preventable diseases drove her to focus on public health .\n\"My father died with diabetes and hypertension .\nMy older brother , and only sibling , died at age 44 of HIV - related illness .\nMy mother died of lung cancer , because as a young girl , she wanted to smoke just like her twin brother could . \"\nDr . Collins' colleagues said he is a natural choice to head the primary federal agency for funding and conducting medical research because of his thoughtfulness , willingness to listen and experience as a spokesman for the genome mapping effort .\n\"He's a forceful personality , \" said Tom Murray , PhD , head of the Hastings Center , an independent bioethics research institute .\n\"He wants to hear from people who don't agree with him . \"\nPatients before profits\nIf confirmed , Dr . Benjamin would be the nation's lead public health educator .\nFellow physicians see the role as a good fit .\nBesides experience with family illnesses , Dr . Benjamin said she also was influenced by her medical school training under David Satcher , MD , PhD , who later became surgeon general , and others who focused on public health issues in underserved areas .\nJorge Alsip , MD , the Alabama medical society's president , said Dr . Benjamin has seen how much patients in poor and rural areas appreciate her help .\n\"That can't help but affect you and make you want to do something for these people , \" said Dr . Alsip , an emergency physician who has known Dr . Benjamin for more than 15 years .\nDr . Alsip also said Dr . Benjamin is tenacious .\n\"If Regina's in a fight , don't ever bet against her . \"\nShe rebuilt her clinic in Bayou La Batre , Ala . , twice after hurricanes destroyed it and is rebuilding it a third time after a fire .\nObama said his surgeon general pick has personally witnessed how the U . S . health system is broken .\n\"She's seen an increasing number of patients who've had health insurance their entire lives suddenly lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simply become too expensive . \"\nDr . Benjamin lamented the difficulty some doctors face in caring for patients , regardless of ability to pay .\n\"It shouldn't be this expensive for Americans to get health care in this country , \" she said .\nObama said Dr . Benjamin has forgone a salary when her clinic faced financial hardship .\nJeff Terry , MD , chair of the AMA's Alabama delegation and a urologist , said Dr . Benjamin has proven herself through work in organized medicine and elsewhere .\nThe two co - founded the young physicians section of the state medical society nearly two decades ago .\nSince then , she has held leadership positions in physician organizations and other groups .\nDr . Benjamin is also probably more politically liberal than many physicians on Alabama's Gulf Coast , Dr . Terry said .\n\"Maybe President Obama saw a little of that in her . \"\nBoth scientific and religious\nObama lauded Dr . Collins' experience in the July 8 announcement .\n\"Dr . Collins is one of the top scientists in the world , and his groundbreaking work has changed the very ways we consider our health and examine disease . \"\nDr .

Benjamin has an extensive and distinguished career in medicine .\nShe is the Founder and CEO of the Bayou La Batre Rural Health Clinic in Alabama , which aims to provide primary care to people of any age regardless of their financial situation .\nShe previously served as Chair of the Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States , and as the Associate Dean for Rural Health at the University of South Alabama College of Medicine .\nAdditionally , she was chosen as President of the Medical Association of Alabama in 2002 , becoming the first African - American woman to be president of a state medical society .\nShe was also the first African - American woman and physician under 40 to be elected to the American Medical Association Board of Trustees .\nShe received the Nelson Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights in 1998 , among other honors .\nThe President emphasized this experience in his remarks , chronicling her dedication to providing health care for her rural community in the face of adversity :\nAnd that's why , even though she could have left the state to make more money as a specialist or as a doctor in a wealthier community , Regina Benjamin returned to Alabama and opened a small clinic in Bayou La Batre .\nWhen people couldn't pay , she didn't charge them .\nWhen the clinic wasn't making money , she didn't take a salary for herself .\nWhen Hurricane George destroyed the clinic in 1998 , she made house calls to all her patients while it was rebuilt .\nWhen Hurricane Katrina destroyed it again and left most of her town homeless , she mortgaged her house and maxed out her credit cards to rebuild that clinic for a second time .\nShe tended to those who had been wounded in the storm , and when folks needed medicine , she asked the pharmacist to send the bill her way .\nAnd when Regina's clinic was about to open for the third time , and a fire burned it to the ground before it could serve the first patient , well , you can guess what Dr . Benjamin did .\nWith help from her community , she is rebuilding it again .\nOne disabled patient brought her an envelope with $20 inside .\nAnother elderly man said simply , \"Maybe I can help .\nI got a hammer . \"\nFor nearly two decades , Dr . Regina Benjamin has seen in a very personal way what is broken about our health care system .\nShe's seen an increasing number of patients who've had health insurance their entire lives suddenly lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simply become too expensive .\nShe's been a relentless promoter of prevention and wellness programs , having treated too many costly and - - diseases and complications that didn't have to happen .\nAnd she's witnessed the shortage of primary care physicians in the rural and underserved areas where she works .\nBut for all that she's seen and all the tremendous obstacles that she has overcome , Regina Benjamin also represents what's best about health care in America - - doctors and nurses who give and care and sacrifice for the sake of their patients ; those Americans who would do anything to heal a fellow citizen .\nAs the President explained , through this personal experience working with the poor and uninsured , Dr . Benjamin understands firsthand the urgent need for health care reform .\nAs Surgeon General , she will be the people's health advocate , and will play a key role in health care reform .\nIn her remarks , Dr . Benjamin explained how she sees her role :\nMy hope , if confirmed as Surgeon General , is to be America's doctor , America's family physician .\nAs we work toward a solution to this health care crisis , I promise to communicate directly with the American people to help guide them through whatever changes may come with health care reform ."

Regina Benjamin\nI was immediately impressed with Dr . Regina Benjamin's background when President Obama nominated her for U . S . Surgeon General .\nShe's led an impressive career , one that includes deciding to practice in a low - income community in the Gulf Coast of Alabama .\nThe Bayou La Batre Rural Health Clinic has been a staple for residents since 1987 and often doesn't charge patients who can't afford to pay .\nThe clinic also focuses heavily on preventative illness since this hits close to home for Dr . Benjamin .\nShe lost her father to diabetics and high - blood pressure , her mother to lung cancer and her brother from a HIV - related illness .\nPersonally and professionally , Dr . Benjamin has longed fought for the well - being of others .\nAfter researching her background , I had a gut feeling she was a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority , Inc . , a non - profit community service based organization .\nAnd it was confirmed several days later when the sorority's national president announced Dr . Benjamin became a member while completing her undergraduate degree at Xavier University in New Orleans , La .\nWhile I wasn't the only one impressed with Dr . Benjamin's background , there were also some who questioned her ability to perform the duties of Surgeon General .\nAn article with the subtitle : \"Do you have to be thin to be fit for the role of nation's Top Doc ? \" , was published shortly after Dr . Benjamin's nomination .\nDr . Arthur Caplan penned the article and defended Dr . Benjamin due to her tireless effort of serving those less fortunate .\nI applaud him for taking a stand on Dr . Benjamin's behalf .\nI don't condone a unhealthy lifestyle , but I'm sure Dr . Benjamin is probably like many of us .\nWith hectic work schedules and families , it can be difficult to find time to lead a healthy lifestyle .\nI struggle with juggling my to - do - list daily and sometimes exercise and healthy eating doesn't make the cut .\nIt's no secret that women are confronted with these issues more than men .\nI'm calling on women to speak up for Dr . Benjamin .\nYou don't have to agree with the policies of President Obama or even with the nomination of Dr . Benjamin , but we can't continue to allow society to dictate our outer appearance .\nWomen , start making your Moves today !"

''\nJackson was driving a 2008 GMC Sierra registered to him , Baehr said .\nHe was booked into county jail and was released by 6 a.m. , Baehr said .\nJackson , in his fourth season , caught a career-high 59 passes and led the team with 1,098 yards , also a career high .\nHis seven receiving touchdowns were also a career best and second on the team .\nEarlier this week , Smith called Jackson a `` true professional '' and `` ultimate team player '' for how hard Jackson played even while not catching any passes .\n`` You win championships with players like Vincent Jackson , '' Smith said .\nThe general manager has put an emphasis on character and avoiding off-the-field issues .\nThe Chargers have not had any arrests become public this season and have been relatively trouble-free in recent years .\nIn 2006 , linebacker Steve Foley was shot by an off-duty Coronado policeman who suspected Foley of driving under the influence .\nFoley pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drunken driving and was placed on five years ' probation .\nIn July , he settled a lawsuit against the city of Coronado for $ 5.5 million .\nJackson 's contract runs through 2009 , and he is among the hottest young receivers in the league .\nWhat becomes of this incident , combined with the previous DUI , could affect Jackson 's long-term future with the Chargers .\nSmith has let go a number of players who have had off-the-field troubles .\nWhile none was as productive or possessed the upside of Jackson , Smith did last February release tackle Shane Olivea just two years after signing Olivea to a contract that guaranteed him $ 9 million .\nOlivea later underwent treatment for an addiction to pain killers .\n`` You 're a Charger one year at a time , '' Smith has often said .\nRecently , speaking of the lack of incidents involving his players , Smith said , `` It 's very important if you want to be a Charger you do the right things on and off the field . ''\nThe Chargers leave Friday for Pittsburgh , where they will face the Steelers at 1:45 p.m. Sunday ."

  "marked_doc": "Maurice Cheeks was fired Saturday as coach of the Philadelphia 76ers , who are slumping at 9-14 a year after making the <mark id=\"mark_id\"> playoffs </mark> .\nAssistant general manager Tony DiLeo was appointed coach for rest of the season .\nThe dismissal came hours before the 76ers were to play at home , with DiLeo making his coaching debut against Washington .\nTeam president Ed Stefanski said he met with Cheeks , describing the former 76er star as a `` gentleman throughout '' and a `` class act . ''\n`` I felt we were not progressing the way we had wanted to progress , '' Stefanski said .\n`` I did n't feel on the floor we were executing the philosophy we wanted to have as Sixers basketball . ''\nCheeks was one of more the popular players in 76ers history and was starting his fourth season as coach. Stefanski had given Cheeks two contract extensions in the past season , but the slow start was enough to cost him his job .\nCheeks became the fifth NBA coach fired this season following P.J. Carlesimo ( Oklahoma City ) , Eddie Jordan ( Washington ) , Sam Mitchell ( Toronto ) and Randy Wittman ( Minnesota ) .\nA message left on Cheeks ' cell phone was not immediately returned .\nDiLeo has spent 19 seasons with the 76ers .\nHe was promoted to senior vice president/assistant general manager in 2003 .\nHis son , T.J. DiLeo , is a guard for Temple and he said after the Owls ' 88-72 win over No. 8 Tennessee that he was excited his father had a chance to coach .\n`` I think it 's unfortunate for Mo , he 's a great coach , but my dad is ready to step in , `` DiLeo said .\n`` This caught us by surprise .\nWe had no idea . ''\nDiLeo said he had n't talked to his father yet , but noticed one missed call from him on his cell phone .\nCheeks led the 76ers to the playoffs last year for the first time while he was coach .\nPhiladelphia was one of the surprise teams in the East last season , and the 76ers anticipated a deep run in the playoffs this year .\nThey signed Elton Brand to a five-year deal worth nearly $ 80 million last summer , but they have struggled with him in the lineup and have lost eight of 10 .\nLast season , the 76ers lost in the first round to Detroit .\nAfter an 18-30 start , Philadelphia won 18 of its next 23 games and wound up at 40-42 , the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference .\nStefanski rewarded Cheeks with two contract extensions in seven months that would have taken him to the end of next season .\nInstead , with the team on a three-game losing streak and last in the Atlantic Division , he did n't even last until the end of the calendar year .\nCheeks also coached at Portland .\nHe played 15 seasons in the NBA , the first 11 with Philadelphia , and retired in 1993 .\nAn outstanding defensive player , Cheeks played in four All-Star games and was a member of the 76ers ' championship team in 1982-83 .\nHis No. 10 jersey hangs in the rafters ."

decent low-post play .\nBut now , Brand is the man in the paint , forcing everyone else out on the perimeter .\nLeft to fend for himself on the weakside , Dalembert 's numbers have plummeted , and Williams has just begun to play well .\nBrand is recovered from the Achilles ' injury that kept him out of all but eight games last season with the Clippers , but he 's been slowed by a bad hamstring , and his offensive numbers ( 15.9 points , a career-low .436 from the floor ) have been unspectactular .\nNo matter what the stats say , Philly looks and plays slower this season .\nAnd Stefanski did n't get a big-time shooter who could stretch the court and take pressure off of Brand inside .\nVeterans Donyell Marshall and Kareem Rush , signed later in the summer by Philly , do n't strike much fear into opposing teams .\nThe result is Philly 's 93.3 scoring average , 28th in the league ( only Charlotte and Oklahoma City have scored 100 points fewer times than Philadelphia 's six ) , and .314 percentage behind the three-point line , 26th in the league .\n`` Everybody zones them , '' an Eastern Conference executive said Saturday .\nThe Sixers had just scored one of their more impressive victories eight days ago , rallying from a double-digit deficit in the second half to win on the road at Detroit .\nTrue , they had bad losses early to the Bobcats and Timberwolves , and lost a home-and-home to the Cavaliers on Wednesday and Friday .\nBut last we checked , Cleveland was 20-3 , owner of an 11-game win streak and the only remaining undefeated team at home this season .\nThe Cavs are rolling , and losing to them is no embarassment .\nAnother league source with knowledge of the team 's thinking said Saturday that the Cleveland losses played no role in Cheeks 's firing .\nCheeks received his second one-year contract extension in less than a year last September , taking him through the 2009-10 season .\nWhile Stefanski did n't hire Cheeks ( that was former president Billy King , whom Stefanski replaced early last season ) , Stefanski and Cheeks had quickly established a solid , working relationship with one another .\nCheeks quickly acquiesced last year when Stefanski asked him to give more time to the team 's younger players , getting Young and young vets Rodney Carney and Williams bigger minutes .\nThe transition transformed the team , as the 76ers went on a 19-7 run last spring , turning opponents over and becoming deadly in transition .\nThey rode their hot streak into the playoffs , where they stretched Detroit to six games before succumbing in the first round .\nThey were n't a finished product , though , and it was no secret that Brand was Stefanski 's target , just as he 'd been King 's ultimate target .\nAfter a brief dalliance with Atlanta free agent Josh Smith , So Stefanski cleared as much cap room as possible , sending Carney and center Calvin Booth to Minnesota , and then struck , getting Brand to spurn his former team , the Clippers , as well as the Warriors , for the Sixers ' $ 80 million offer -- the `` Philly Max , '' as Brand later called it .\nAfter keeping Iguodala and Williams , all the heat was on Cheeks .\nSaturday , he became the latest coach -- one-sixth of the league 's head men already gone in little more than five weeks -- to succumb to the pyre ."

Carlesimo pile .\nMany felt Cheeks was the victim of a regime change and not his own failure in Portland ; as such , he seemed like a safe pick for the Philly job ( especially considering his history in the town ) .\nBut although there has been change in the Sixers ' front office ( current GM Ed Stefanski did n't hire Cheeks , in other words ) , this sacking is more tied to the team 's failure .\nYou fail 1.5 times in today 's NBA , you might be done for a while. Cheeks is smooth and well-liked , so he could get a gig soon enough .\nBut it seems more likely that he 'd get back on the bench as an assistant or move to a college program"

M . FEB . 4 , 2009\nTwo years ago , the Chargers won an NFL special award for helping start a San Diego program by which players who've been imbibing can call a private number for a ride home , an alternative to driving under the influence .\nA former Chargers fullback , Lorenzo Neal , was among the co - founders of the \u201c Safe Ride Solutions \u201d program that since has been expanded to other NFL cities .\nEvidently , though , the drinking and driving problem hasn't been eradicated in San Diego .\nSunday , for the second time in less than four weeks , a Chargers player was pulled over in the early - morning hours and arrested on suspicion of DUI .\n\u201c It's disappointing to hear about the issue involving Jamal Williams , \u201d said General Manager A . J . Smith in a news release issued by the team yesterday .\n\u201c We'll continue to monitor the situation and let the legal process run its course . \u201d\nSmith's statement served as the only comment from the Chargers .\nA request to interview club President Dean Spanos was declined by a spokesman .\nAs it is , the Chargers are still awaiting the disposition of a similar case involving wide receiver Vincent Jackson , arrested Jan . 6 in Clairemont on suspicion of driving under the influence .\nJackson , also facing charges of driving while on probation for a prior DUI , has an arraignment set for Feb . 17 in San Diego Superior Court .\nWilliams , a three - time Pro Bowl nose tackle , was stopped for speeding westbound on state route 94 at approximately 1 : 30 a . m Sunday .\nArrested by the CHP on suspicion of drunken driving , he was booked into county jail and later released on bond .\nResults of Williams' blood - alcohol test have not been released .\n\u201c These are just two more arrests that we've had , \u201d said Pat Hodgkin , local executive director of Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) , noting that roughly 13 , 000 DUI convictions are issued every year in San Diego County .\n\u201c However , these are media - worthy professionals .\nThese are individuals that not only youth looks up to , but adults look up to as well .\nThey need to understand that they have an effect on people and a responsibility . \u201d\nThe Chargers were involved in one of the most publicized and bizarre instances of a DUI stop in 2006 .\nLinebacker Steve Foley was shot three times by an off - duty Coronado police officer who followed Foley from downtown to the player's home in Poway .\nFoley , his career ended by the bullet wounds , later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor DUI .\nIt was that case that prompted Gary Lawrence , a detective with the Northern Division of the San Diego Police Department , to ally with the Chargers in a program in which players who've been drinking would call \u201c Safe Ride Solutions \u201d and be driven home by an off - duty member of law enforcement .\n\u201c Anytime anybody's arrested for DUI , I get very disappointed , and not just when athletes are involved , \u201d said Lawrence yesterday .\n\u201c We're talking about a crime where people are killed or injured , a crime where people go to jail , and it's 100 percent preventable . \u201d\nCiting his company's confidentiality agreement with clients , Lawrence declined to discuss anything specific pertaining to the Chargers and their players .\nFrom its start with the team , though , the business has grown to include clients from other high - profile realms and put to work by other NFL franchises .\nIn recognition of the program , the league gave the Chargers its Winston - Shell Award in 2007 for \u201c demonstrating commitment and dedication to developing unique and innovative ideas and solutions . \u201d"

He bleeds Philadelphia , \" team president Billy King said .\nCheeks will be introduced as Philadelphia's 21st head coach at a Tuesday news conference .\nPhiladelphia is certainly banking on the former point guard to have a happier homecoming than O'Brien , a Philadelphia native who played for Saint Joseph's .\nO'Brien's stubbornness and seemingly unwavering belief in a system that didn't fit his players cost him his job despite a 43 - 39 record and a return to the playoffs .\n\"I just felt the direction we were going and the overall play wasn't where we wanted to go , \" King said .\nO'Brien just finished the first year of a three - year deal that included an option and paid him about $4 million a year .\nO'Brien , though , was not very popular with his players - - most notably former All - Star Chris Webber - - who often complained about their roles .\nKing said after the Sixers were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Detroit that he planned to bring O'Brien back .\nAfter meeting with his players and other members of management , King had a change of heart and decided over the weekend he had to make a change .\nCertainly , King knows a thing or two about making changes - - Cheeks will be the fifth Sixers coach in four years under his watch .\nLarry Brown left for Detroit following the 2002 - 03 season , and assistant Randy Ayers was promoted and fired 52 games into the 2003 - 04 season before he was replaced by Chris Ford .\n\"I knew this thing was coming , and it wasn't an easy thing for anybody , \" Brown said from Miami before coaching the Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals .\n\"Knowing Billy , it's not easy to let a coach go .\nHis relationship with Randy was pretty strong .\nI think it was hard for him to let Chris go .\nHe was excited about having Jimmy , but I don't think it ever gets easy . \"\nCheeks was one of the most popular 76ers from 1978 - 89 and played on Philadelphia's last championship team in 1983 .\nHe also spent seven seasons as an assistant coach for the 76ers , was part of the staff under Brown when they went to the NBA Finals in 2001 and developed a strong bond with Allen Iverson .\nCheeks was fired March 2 after nearly four seasons as coach of the Trail Blazers .\nHe had a 162 - 139 record in Portland , the fourth - highest win total in Blazers history .\nCheeks guided the team to the playoffs his first two seasons , but the players hardly made Cheeks' tenure easy - - on or off the court .\nThe team was nicknamed the \"Jail Blazers\" after several brushes with the law , many of them involving marijuana possession .\n\"If players have problems with Mo Cheeks . . . then there's got to be something wrong with those players , \" King said .\nBut Cheeks' return to the city where he was a four - time All - Star shouldn't come as a surprise .\nThe Trail Blazers turned down Philadelphia's request to speak to Cheeks as a possible replacement for Brown , but the former point guard always remained popular with Philly fans and was at the top of the Sixers' short list to take over for Ford .\nNow , they'll get their wish .\n\"We do not want to change coaches [ again ] , \" Sixers chairman Ed Snider said .\n\"We've seen enough coaches . \"\nThe Sixers will pay Ayers , O'Brien and Cheeks next season .\n\"I don't think it's something we're very proud of , but I don't think it reflects poorly , \" Snider said .\nO'Brien is the son - in - law of Hall of Fame coach Jack Ramsay .\nHe led the Sixers to a 10 - win improvement from a year ago and they returned to the playoffs , largely on the back of a healthy , happy Iverson .\nWhile O'Brien avoided public spats with Iverson , he did not have the full support of the rest of the team .\nSome of the younger players , like Samuel Dalembert and Willie Green , felt they did not develop like they should have under O'Brien and were unsure about their roles .\n\"In looking at the development of some of them , yeah , I wasn't pleased , \" King said .\nThe Sixers also failed to really understand O'Brien's defense , a sticking point even in the postseason .\n\"Some of the criteria on our defense wasn't there , \" King said .\nCheeks , who once famously came to the rescue of a 13 - year - old girl who forgot the words to the national anthem before a playoff game , now hopes to bail out his former team and bring them another championship .\n\"Mo has played this game here in Philadelphia , won a championship here in Philadelphia , understands players , understands defenses , understands the way I think we want to play , \" King said ."

  "marked_doc": "Not because Mo Cheeks was long for the job with the Philadelphia 76ers .\nLike all coaches not in the upper stratosphere of the coaching hierarchy -- your Phil Jacksons and Gregg Popoviches -- he was only as good as his last 10-game stretch , only as secure as how well his star was playing .\nBut the 76ers , while underachieving at 9-14 when Cheeks was fired Saturday morning , were not an embarassment when they <mark id=\"mark_id\"> went </mark> on the court , not a disjointed bunch that clearly was no longer listening to or playing for its coach .\nThis was n't P.J. Carlesimo ( Oklahoma City ) or Eddie Jordan ( Washington ) , whose team 's putrid won-loss records sank any chance they had of survival .\nThis was n't Sam Mitchell ( Toronto ) , whose differences of opinion with his general manager about his team 's personnel were too big to overcome .\nThis was n't Randy Wittman ( Minnesota ) , whose fan base was staying away in droves as the paying public grew indifferent to the on-court product .\nThe timing of this move by team president and general manager Ed Stefanski was a head-scratcher .\n`` It 's not 100 percent on the coach , '' a source with knowledge of the 76ers ' thinking said Saturday afternoon .\n`` But at the same time , we did n't seem to have a plan . ''\nStefanski named assistant general manager Tony DiLeo coach for the rest of the season .\nDiLeo has a good reputation as a coach , spending time over the last two decades on the Sixers ' bench as an assistant and in Europe as a head coach .\nBut unless circumstances change dramatically , Jordan -- who became close with Stefanski while both were in New Jersey earlier this decade -- will be the odds-on favorite to get the job permanantly .\nMany league execs still think quite highly of Jordan , and none of the players who matter in Washington threw Jordan under the bus after he was fired .\nCheeks ' coaching moves have frequently been criticized over the years , both in Philadelphia and in Portland .\nBut he lost his job this time not only because of Xs and Os , but because so many of the 76ers ' players that blossomed under him last season , including center Sam Dalembert , forward Andre Iguodala and guard Lou Williams , struggled to get going this season .\nAnd the moves Cheeks made , like benching second-year forward Thaddeus Young and elevating guard Willie Green , have n't produced enough dividends .\n`` Ed just was n't seeing any progress , '' the source said , and Stefanski expected more from a team that had signed free agent Elton Brand to an $ 82 million deal and re-signed core players Iguodala and Williams for $ 80 million and $ 25 million , respectively .\n`` We were n't progressing at the rate [ Stefanski ] thought we should , and he thought it was time for a move , '' the source said .\nYet Stefanski can not escape criticism , either .\nBringing Brand in was the signing coup of the NBA offseason , to be sure .\nBut in doing that , Stefanski changed the team 's footprint .\nThe Sixers are still a very good transition team .\nBut when the game slows down , having to cater to Brand leaves the lane clogged .\nLast season , Iguodala , Young and Williams had driving room when Philly ran its halfcourt sets , and Dalembert showed occasional decent low-post play .\nBut now , Brand is the man in the paint , forcing everyone else out on the perimeter .\nLeft to fend for himself on the weakside , Dalembert 's numbers have plummeted , and Williams has just begun to play well .\nBrand is recovered from the Achilles ' injury that kept him out of all but eight games last season with the Clippers , but he 's been slowed by a bad hamstring , and his offensive numbers ( 15.9 points , a career-low .436 from the floor ) have been unspectactular .\nNo matter what the stats say , Philly looks and plays slower this season .\nAnd Stefanski did n't get a big-time shooter who could stretch the court and take pressure off of Brand inside .\nVeterans Donyell Marshall and Kareem Rush , signed later in the summer by Philly , do n't strike much fear into opposing teams .\nThe result is Philly 's 93.3 scoring average , 28th in the league ( only Charlotte and Oklahoma City have scored 100 points fewer times than Philadelphia 's six ) , and .314 percentage behind the three-point line , 26th in the league .\n`` Everybody zones them , '' an Eastern Conference executive said Saturday .\nThe Sixers had just scored one of their more impressive victories eight days ago , rallying from a double-digit deficit in the second half to win on the road at Detroit .\nTrue , they had bad losses early to the Bobcats and Timberwolves , and lost a home-and-home to the Cavaliers on Wednesday and Friday .\nBut last we checked , Cleveland was 20-3 , owner of an 11-game win streak and the only remaining undefeated team at home this season .\nThe Cavs are rolling , and losing to them is no embarassment .\nAnother league source with knowledge of the team 's thinking said Saturday that the Cleveland losses played no role in Cheeks 's firing .\nCheeks received his second one-year contract extension in less than a year last September , taking him through the 2009-10 season .\nWhile Stefanski did n't hire Cheeks ( that was former president Billy King , whom Stefanski replaced early last season ) , Stefanski and Cheeks had quickly established a solid , working relationship with one another .\nCheeks quickly acquiesced last year when Stefanski asked him to give more time to the team 's younger players , getting Young and young vets Rodney Carney and Williams bigger minutes .\nThe transition transformed the team , as the 76ers went on a 19-7 run last spring , turning opponents over and becoming deadly in transition .\nThey rode their hot streak into the playoffs , where they stretched Detroit to six games before succumbing in the first round .\nThey were n't a finished product , though , and it was no secret that Brand was Stefanski 's target , just as he 'd been King 's ultimate target .\nAfter a brief dalliance with Atlanta free agent Josh Smith , So Stefanski cleared as much cap room as possible , sending Carney and center Calvin Booth to Minnesota , and then struck , getting Brand to spurn his former team , the Clippers , as well as the Warriors , for the Sixers ' $ 80 million offer -- the `` Philly Max , '' as Brand later called it .\nAfter keeping Iguodala and Williams , all the heat was on Cheeks .\nSaturday , he became the latest coach -- one-sixth of the league 's head men already gone in little more than five weeks -- to succumb to the pyre ."
