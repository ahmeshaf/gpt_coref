you're going to heaven , \" the man says . <p/>\"Rarely if ever in the criminal justice system in Texas have we ever encouraged a person such as Warren Jeffs , whose criminal conduct spans decades , multiple jurisdictions and hundreds of victims , \" Nichols said . <p/>A former member of the church , Rebecca Musser , said the verdict will not bring back lost innocence . <p/>But she said it can help others escape from abuse they may have suffered . <p/>\"Whether the currency is God or greed , the trafficking of women and children for sex is a form of slavery , \" she said . <p/>Jeffs is the eighth person from the ranch to be convicted on sexual assault , bigamy and other charges , according to the Texas Attorney General's office . <p/>Four others are awaiting trial . <p/>Attorney General Greg Abbott said he believes authorities have rooted out the molesters from the ranch , but will continue to monitor the church's activities there . <p/>\"We have an ongoing open investigation that will evaluate all evidence about any kind of wrongdoing out there at the compound whatsoever , \" Abbott said . <p/>Jurors came back with the sentence after 30 minutes of deliberations Tuesday . <p/>They began their work Tuesday morning following brief closing statements by prosecutor Nichols . <p/>Jeffs , who has argued that he and his faith were being persecuted , instructed his attorneys to deliver no closing statement . <p/>\"This is not the prosecution to persecute a people , this is a prosecution to protect a people , \" Nichols told jurors . <p/>Jeffs did not attend the closing statement . <p/>In addition to tape recordings that the state said depicted sex acts with minors , prosecutors also presented evidence that Jeffs knew he was wanted by federal authorities and that his behavior would be shunned by outsiders . <p/>FBI Special Agent John Broadway testified that Jeffs ordered the destruction of various discs and transcripts three days after an arrest warrant was issued for him on June 10 , 2005 . <p/>The polygamist sect leader established \"houses of hiding , \" allegedly with young girls for him to marry , Broadway said . <p/>The FBI agent also read from a priesthood record , in which Jeffs allegedly wrote : \"Things are happening so quickly . <p/>There is an even younger girl that the Lord wants me to take . <p/>She is 13 . <p/>For some reason the Lord is sending me these girls that can be worked with . \" <p/>Jeffs also wrote : \"If the world knew what I was doing , they would hang me from the highest tree , \" according to evidence presented in court . <p/>Referring to that comment , prosecutor Nichols said during his closing statement that \"Yes , this is Texas . <p/>But no , we don't hang convicts anymore from the highest tree , and we don't have the ability to call down the wrath of the Almighty . . . <p/>We as a people choose to isolate our worst offenders , to keep them away from their past and future victims . \" <p/>Jeffs' breakaway sect is believed to have about 10 , 000 followers . <p/>Their practice of polygamy , which the mainstream Mormon Church renounced more than a century ago , is part of the sect's doctrine .",

  "marked_doc": "B.C. attorney general confirms charges laid against top two polygamist leaders <p/>Two top leaders of the controversial polygamous sect in Bountiful , B.C. , have been arrested and charged with practising polygamy . <p/>B.C. Attorney General Wally Oppal confirmed that Winston Blackmore and James Oler were arrested Wednesday . <p/>Oppal said Blackmore is alleged to be married to 20 women , while Oler is accused of committing polygamy by being married to two women . <p/>`` This has been a very complex issue , '' he told The Canadian Press . <p/>`` It 's been with us for well over 20 years . <p/>The problem has always been the defence of religion has always been raised . '' <p/>Oppal said some legal experts have believed that a charge for practising polygamy would n't withstand a Charter of Rights challenge over the issue of freedom of religion . <p/>`` I 've always disagreed with that , '' he said . <p/>`` I 've always taken the position that 's a valid offence in law . <p/>And if someone says that it 's contrary to their religion let a judge make that decision . '' <p/>He said he 's pleased a prosecution will proceed , providing some clarity to whether the law will be upheld by the courts . <p/>Oppal said in 2005 , when he was appointed attorney general , that he was concerned about the polygamy issue in Bountiful `` because of the exploitation of women and children . '' <p/>The community had come under investigation in the past but Oppal said he asked RCMP to reopen the investigation shortly after he was elected . <p/>Sgt. Tim Shields told reporters that Creston RCMP began an investigation into allegations of polygamy and sexual exploitation in the fall of 2005 . <p/>That investigation was completed in September 2006 and recommendation was made to Crown for charges to be laid . <p/>A follow-up investigation began last September and the two men were arrested this morning and taken to the RCMP detachment in Cranbrook , B.C. , Shields <mark id=\"mark_id\"> said </mark> . <p/>The men were expected to appear in court Wednesday afternoon . <p/>Last June , Oppal appointed a special prosecutor to look into allegations of criminal abuse at Bountiful , saying renewed public concerns compelled him to act . <p/>That came despite two earlier legal opinions that it would be difficult to proceed with polygamy charges . <p/>Officials at the Mormon Hills School in Bountiful , where Blackmore is the superintendent , said he was arrested Wednesday . <p/>About 800 people live in the community in southeastern B.C. , where members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints practice multiple marriage . <p/>The sect is a breakaway offshoot of the Mormon church , which renounced polygamy more than a century ago . <p/>Blackmore , who is the leader of one of two groups within the community , openly admits to having numerous wives and dozens of children but has said the community abhors sexual abuse of children . <p/>However , Blackmore has refused in previous interviews to discuss allegations that teenaged girls in the community marry older men or that others are sent to polygamous groups in the United States . <p/>Oler is the leader of the other group in the community , which has long been divided . <p/>The issue of polygamy in British Columbia came up again last year after more than 450 children were apprehended by child-welfare authorities from a sister polygamous community in Texas . <p/>At least one of the girls in that case was from Bountiful , refocusing the spotlight on a community that has existed in relative obscurity in B.C. 's Kootenays , not far from the U.S. border . <p/>And polygamist leader Warren Jeffs , the sect 's prophet in the U.S. , is behind bars south of the border . <p/>He was convicted in Utah as an accomplice to rape and faces trial in Arizona on other charges related to the marriages of members of sect there . <p/>After the special prosecutor was announced , Blackmore accused Oppal of religious persecution . <p/>`` It can not possibly be about polygamy , '' Blackmore wrote in an email to The Canadian Press last June . <p/>`` It must be about his own religious bias and now he wants the Liberal government to persecute some of the citizens that they have an obligation to serve and protect . '' <p/>Blackmore has said he has tried to meet with Oppal in the past , but that the attorney general has refused .",

. . . <p/>This individual considers himself to be the prophet . <p/>Everything he did , hour after hour , he was required to keep a record of that . \" <p/>On one of the tapes played at the trial , Jeffs made a reference to \"drawing close\" or \"being close , \" which authorities testified is how church members refer to sex . <p/>Two female voices said \"OK . \" <p/>\"A good wife is trained for her husband and follows the spirit of peace , \" Jeffs was heard saying . <p/>Another audio tape included Jeffs and the younger girl from a recording made in August 2006 at the Texas compound , according to testimony from Nick Hanna , a Texas Ranger involved in the 2008 raid . <p/>Played in court , it was difficult to decipher , but Jeffs' and a female voice are heard . <p/>He says , \"I perform this service in the name of Jesus Christ , Amen , \" then mentions the alleged victim by name . <p/>When she says something , he responds , \"don't talk while praying . \" <p/>Several minutes of heavy breathing followed . <p/>The jury wore headphones to better hear the recording and also followed a transcript . <p/>One female juror covered her face with her hand as she listened . <p/>Jeffs represented himself after firing seven attorneys in the six months leading to the trial . <p/>He broke his courtroom silence with an objection marked by a nearly hourlong speech defending polygamy , and twice threatened the judge and the court with warnings of punishment from God . <p/>He refused to cross - examine the state's witnesses , and delayed giving an opening statement until he began presenting his own defense . <p/>In that statement , he evoked images of the civil rights movement and mentioned former Mormon leader Joseph Smith Jr . <p/>He also asked the jury to remember constitutional guarantees of religious freedom . <p/>The lone defense witness Jeffs called , church elder JD Roundy , spent about 10 minutes on the stand Thursday discussing FLDS history after 4 . 5 hours of testimony Wednesday evening . <p/>Jeffs failed three times to remove state District Judge Barbara Walther from the case , the last rejection coming even without a hearing . <p/>He claimed Walther was biased because she issued the warrant for the original raid and was frequently updated as it progressed . <p/>Eleven other FLDS men were charged with crimes including sexual assault and bigamy . <p/>All seven of those who have been prosecuted were convicted , receiving prison sentences of between six and 75 years .",

  "marked_doc": "http : / / www . deseretnews . com / article / 700167816 / Texas - jury - hears - Warren - Jeffs - sex - tapes - despite - FLDS - leaders - objections . html ? pg=all <p/>Texas jury <mark id=\"mark_id\"> hears </mark> Warren Jeffs sex tapes despite FLDS leader's objections <p/>Published : Tuesday , Aug . 2 2011 7 : 08 p . m . MDT <p/>Prosecutors Tuesday put on the most shocking evidence yet in the trial of Warren Jeffs , who is charged with sexually assaulting underage girls . <p/>Prosecutors played two audio recordings of Jeffs instructing his 14 - year - old \"spiritual wife\" and several other young women on how to please him sexually , and thus win favor with God . <p/>Jeffs seemed determined to halt the trial , and the judge repeatedly warned him to stop talking and sit down - even threatened to kick him out of his own trial . <p/>Once the jury had headphones and started listening to a recording , Jeffs repeatedly objected , interrupting the recording many times . <p/>On the tape , Jeffs' voice drones on for well over two hours , using Biblical language and sometimes speaking in the voice of God , counseling a number of his plural wives to perform what he calls the \"ordinance of heavenly comfort . \" <p/>He promises they will feel the all - consuming fire of heaven , and by giving comfort to their husband , they will be touching God . <p/>The recordings were part of the mountain of documents seized in a law enforcement raid in 2008 . <p/>On the recording , there are many long minutes in which it's hard to make out exactly what's happening . <p/>But it seems to include sounds of fumbling with clothing , sobbing , flushing of toilets . <p/>At one point Jeffs tells the girls or women , \"You have to know how to be excited sexually . <p/>You have to be able to assist each other . \" <p/>It all ends with prayers and supposed revelations from God , and Jeffs himself singing a hymn . <p/>Jeffs , 55 , is head of the Utah - based Fundamentalist LDS Church , which believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven . <p/>He is accused of sexually assaulting two girls , ages 12 and 15 , he took as brides in what his church calls \"spiritual marriages . \" <p/>A forensic analyst testified Monday that Jeffs was the father of the 15 - year - old's child . <p/>On Tuesday , prosecutors also played a tape of Jeffs talking to the girl when she was 14 , after Texas Ranger Nick Hanna testified about documents and electronic files seized during a 2008 police raid at the church's remote compound in West Texas . <p/>Among the materials recovered during the raid was a record of Jeffs' marriage \"for time and all eternity\" with the 14 - year - old in January 2004 . <p/>An excerpt from hundreds of pages of Jeffs' personal journals said the child was \"pure and innocent and willing to obey\" and that he summoned her parents and \"informed them of their girl belonging to me . \" <p/>Followers see Jeffs as a prophet who is God's spokesman on earth . <p/>Hanna read from Jeffs' journals , which said he took the 14 - year - old the night after their wedding with him and another of his new wives on a car ride for \"training . \" <p/>There , he instructed them on their responsibilities as his wives and had the session taped . <p/>The recording was transcribed and placed in church records later seized by police . <p/>Lead prosecutor Eric Nichols played the tape for jurors , who followed along using transcripts . <p/>\"A good wife is trained for her husband and follows the spirit of peace , \" Jeffs is heard saying . <p/>He also makes reference to \"drawing close\" or \"being close , \" which is how church members refer to sex . <p/>Two female voices say \"OK . \" <p/>In describing the session in his journal later , Jeffs said he told his wives they were \"honorable vessels , property of your husband's kingdom and the Kingdom of God on Earth . \" <p/>Jeffs has represented himself since firing his high - powered attorneys last week . <p/>Later , Nichols played a 58 - minute clip of another so - called training session from December 2004 , this one involving what he described as 12 \"young\" ladies , including the one from the first recording . <p/>Jeffs stood up and talked over it , rambling about how a holy trust was being broken . <p/>\"I am but a mortal man seeking peace , \" he said . <p/>\"I am not a threat to anyone . <p/>My faith is my only weapon . \" <p/>Prosecutors have promised to play still another recording - this one of Jeffs having sex with the 12 - year - old girl - before resting their case . <p/>Nichols told Walther they would do so at the end of a court session that stretched late into Tuesday night . <p/>Before the recordings , Hanna read excerpts of Jeffs' journal where he described the Lord ordering him to visit Eldorado , Texas , about 45 miles south of San Angelo , and the church purchasing 1 , 700 acres of land outside the town for $1 . 2 million in 2003 . <p/>\"This will only be a place of refuge if it is kept sacred and secret , \" Jeffs wrote , adding that his followers should populate the area and let \"a community grow here more in hiding before the neighbors find out . \" <p/>He told the faithful they could build anything they wanted , thanks to Texas' lax zoning laws , and construction teams working around - the - clock erected more than a dozen buildings , including a sprawling , white - limestone temple . <p/>Texas authorities raided the compound in April 2008 after receiving a call to an abuse hotline that turned out to be a hoax . <p/>More than 400 FLDS children who were placed in protective custody were eventually returned to their families . <p/>But police saw underage girls who were clearly pregnant and found Jeffs' journals and the other documents in a vault at the end of a secret passageway in the temple . <p/>Another vault in an annex building provided still more records and files . <p/>Jeffs and 11 other FLDS men were charged with crimes including sexual assault and bigamy . <p/>So far , all seven who have been prosecuted have been convicted , receiving prison sentences of between six and 75 years .",

MDT <p/>Prosecutors Tuesday put on the most shocking evidence yet in the trial of Warren Jeffs , who is charged with sexually assaulting underage girls . <p/>Prosecutors played two audio recordings of Jeffs instructing his 14 - year - old \"spiritual wife\" and several other young women on how to please him sexually , and thus win favor with God . <p/>Jeffs seemed determined to halt the trial , and the judge repeatedly warned him to stop talking and sit down - even threatened to kick him out of his own trial . <p/>Once the jury had headphones and started listening to a recording , Jeffs repeatedly objected , interrupting the recording many times . <p/>On the tape , Jeffs' voice drones on for well over two hours , using Biblical language and sometimes speaking in the voice of God , counseling a number of his plural wives to perform what he calls the \"ordinance of heavenly comfort . \" <p/>He promises they will feel the all - consuming fire of heaven , and by giving comfort to their husband , they will be touching God . <p/>The recordings were part of the mountain of documents seized in a law enforcement raid in 2008 . <p/>On the recording , there are many long minutes in which it's hard to make out exactly what's happening . <p/>But it seems to include sounds of fumbling with clothing , sobbing , flushing of toilets . <p/>At one point Jeffs tells the girls or women , \"You have to know how to be excited sexually . <p/>You have to be able to assist each other . \" <p/>It all ends with prayers and supposed revelations from God , and Jeffs himself singing a hymn . <p/>Jeffs , 55 , is head of the Utah - based Fundamentalist LDS Church , which believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven . <p/>He is accused of sexually assaulting two girls , ages 12 and 15 , he took as brides in what his church calls \"spiritual marriages . \" <p/>A forensic analyst testified Monday that Jeffs was the father of the 15 - year - old's child . <p/>On Tuesday , prosecutors also played a tape of Jeffs talking to the girl when she was 14 , after Texas Ranger Nick Hanna testified about documents and electronic files seized during a 2008 police raid at the church's remote compound in West Texas . <p/>Among the materials recovered during the raid was a record of Jeffs' marriage \"for time and all eternity\" with the 14 - year - old in January 2004 . <p/>An excerpt from hundreds of pages of Jeffs' personal journals said the child was \"pure and innocent and willing to obey\" and that he summoned her parents and \"informed them of their girl belonging to me . \" <p/>Followers see Jeffs as a prophet who is God's spokesman on earth . <p/>Hanna read from Jeffs' journals , which said he took the 14 - year - old the night after their wedding with him and another of his new wives on a car ride for \"training . \" <p/>There , he instructed them on their responsibilities as his wives and had the session taped . <p/>The recording was transcribed and placed in church records later seized by police . <p/>Lead prosecutor Eric Nichols played the tape for jurors , who followed along using transcripts . <p/>\"A good wife is trained for her husband and follows the spirit of peace , \" Jeffs is heard saying . <p/>He also makes reference to \"drawing close\" or \"being close , \" which is how church members refer to sex . <p/>Two female voices say \"OK . \" <p/>In describing the session in his journal later , Jeffs said he told his wives they were \"honorable vessels , property of your husband's kingdom and the Kingdom of God on Earth . \" <p/>Jeffs has represented himself since firing his high - powered attorneys last week . <p/>Later , Nichols played a 58 - minute clip of another so - called training session from December 2004 , this one involving what he described as 12 \"young\" ladies , including the one from the first recording . <p/>Jeffs stood up and talked over it , rambling about how a holy trust was being broken . <p/>\"I am but a mortal man seeking peace , \" he said . <p/>\"I am not a threat to anyone . <p/>My faith is my only weapon . \" <p/>Prosecutors have promised to play still another recording - this one of Jeffs having sex with the 12 - year - old girl - before resting their case . <p/>Nichols told Walther they would do so at the end of a court session that stretched late into Tuesday night . <p/>Before the recordings , Hanna read excerpts of Jeffs' journal where he described the Lord ordering him to visit Eldorado , Texas , about 45 miles south of San Angelo , and the church purchasing 1 , 700 acres of land outside the town for $1 . 2 million in 2003 . <p/>\"This will only be a place of refuge if it is kept sacred and secret , \" Jeffs wrote , adding that his followers should populate the area and let \"a community grow here more in hiding before the neighbors find out . \" <p/>He told the faithful they could build anything they wanted , thanks to Texas' lax zoning laws , and construction teams working around - the - clock erected more than a dozen buildings , including a sprawling , white - limestone temple . <p/>Texas authorities raided the compound in April 2008 after receiving a call to an abuse hotline that turned out to be a hoax . <p/>More than 400 FLDS children who were placed in protective custody were eventually returned to their families . <p/>But police saw underage girls who were clearly pregnant and found Jeffs' journals and the other documents in a vault at the end of a secret passageway in the temple . <p/>Another vault in an annex building provided still more records and files . <p/>Jeffs and 11 other FLDS men were charged with crimes including sexual assault and bigamy . <p/>So far , all seven who have been prosecuted have been convicted , receiving prison sentences of between six and 75 years .",

'' <p/>Blackmore has been charged with `` practising polygamy '' on May 1 , 2005 and Oler has been charged with the same crime on Nov. 1 , 2004 , according to provincial court files . <p/>`` I am pleased a prosecution will be proceeding , as it will provide legal clarity as to the constitutionality of section 293 of the Criminal Code ( concerning polygamy ) , '' Oppal said in a statement . <p/>News of the charges was welcomed by Audrey Vance , co-chair of Altering Destiny Through Education , which is based in Creston , B.C. , not far from Bountiful . <p/>Vance has lobbied for charges against Bountiful residents . <p/>`` We all know this is a cult and we have to do something to address this because in Canada women do have equal rights , '' she said in an interview Wednesday . <p/>Blackmore , who has had 26 wives and more than 100 children , is outspoken in his belief that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects his religious practice of polygamy - a tenet that was set out by Mormonism 's founder Joseph Smith , but was denounced by the mainstream church in 1890 . <p/>At a polygamy summit in 2006 , Blackmore admitted that he had had `` several '' very young `` wives '' including one who was under 16 . <p/>He repeated that when he was interviewed by CNN 's Larry King . <p/>Blackmore lost his role as the Bountiful bishop after his disagreement with Jeffs , the church 's prophet who has been convicted of being an accomplice to the rape of a minor in Utah and is currently in jail in Arizona facing similar charges there . <p/>Jeffs and other senior FLDS members have also been charged in Texas with offences related to the so-called `` spiritual marriages '' to under-aged girls . <p/>Blackmore now leads a breakaway group that lives in the southeastern corner of B.C. and is the head of the Mormon Hills School Society , which runs a government-funded , independent school . <p/>Over the years , Blackmore amassed a multi-million-dollar business empire that included a post-and-pole company , logging operations and a large farm . <p/>Little is known about Oler , a mechanic . <p/>He has never spoken to the media and there are few photos of him . <p/>However , people within the community have confirmed that Oler has at least three wives , several of whom were in their teens when they were assigned to him in placement marriages by Jeffs .",

Jeffs was a handful from day one with his self - inflicted hunger strikes . \" <p/>Jeffs served as president and prophet of the Fundamentalist Church of the Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints after his father , Rulon Jeffs , died in 2002 . <p/>In June 2005 , days after being indicted in Arizona on the charges of being an accomplice to sexual conduct with a minor , Jeffs fled the Colorado City , Arizona , area , home to a large FLDS community . <p/>A warrant was issued for his arrest and he was placed on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list . <p/>Fourteen months later , he was arrested outside Las Vegas , Nevada , and began his journey from court to court and jail to jail . <p/>Jeffs' defenders claim he is a victim of religious persecution . <p/>He has spent much of his time in jail talking about his faith , fasting and praying . <p/>Tall , slender , with a wide - eyed gaze that seems to compel allegiance among his FLDS followers , Jeffs is a calm presence in court , but his life behind bars has been more tumultuous . <p/>Ill from fasting , his knees bleeding and sore from prolonged prayer sessions , he has been hospitalized and force - fed several times . <p/>He has also been inconsistently penitent . <p/>\"I am one of the most wicked men on the face of the earth since the days of Father Adam , \" Jeffs can be heard saying on a tape recorded by authorities at the Purgatory Jail in St . George , Utah . <p/>Still , Jeffs' attorneys are pledging to fight extradition and also have an appeal of the Utah case pending before the state supreme court . <p/>They also may seek a new trial based on recently uncovered evidence - now under investigation by the Utah Attorney General's Office - that some medical records in the trial may not have been original documents , but reconstructed ones . <p/>Jeffs' legal team says the Utah case must be resolved before their client is moved to Texas . <p/>The ordeal also has been difficult for his alleged victims , says Roger Hoole , an attorney for Elissa Wall and Susie Barlow , former FLDS members and child brides . <p/>\"They have been reviled . <p/>They are hated and they have been scapegoated\" in the FLDS community , Hoole told TIME . <p/>The FLDS communities in northern Arizona and southern Utah have strong , deep roots to the region going back to the mid - 19th century . <p/>Many families bear the same name - evidence of generations of intermarriage - and former FLDS members say communal wealth is used by the leadership to maintain power and punish . <p/>Witnesses have refused to testify in the cases against Jeffs . <p/>Texas prosecutors have sidestepped that problem by using genetic evidence and extensive church documents seized during an April , 2008 raid at the FLDS Yearning for Zion Ranch in West Texas . <p/>Jeffs was indicted in July , 2008 , by a Schleicher County grand jury in Eldorado , Texas , home to the YFZ Ranch . <p/>The state authorities removed more than 400 children from the ranch , plus boxes of evidence , some of which purport to show Jeffs kissing child brides . <p/>He is facing charges of aggravated sexual assault , sexual assault and bigamy charges which could result in at least one life sentence . <p/>If extradited , he will join 12 other FLDS defendants charged with similar offenses . <p/>In a steady march beginning last October , five FLDS members have been convicted of felonies and received sentences ranging from seven to 75 years . <p/>A sixth trial is just getting under way in the small Eldorado courthouse and six more men await trail - seven if Jeffs finds himself in a West Texas jail .",

'' <p/>Injured people had been transported from several affected villages in two trucks , she said . <p/>People ran outside in Banda Aceh as the quake shook houses , and in Medan city to the south of the province on Sumatra island . <p/>\"The quake was felt strongly for around 15 seconds , from Bener Meriah to Banda Aceh . <p/>People panicked and rushed out of their homes , '' said national disaster agency spokesman Nugroho . <p/>Aceh , on the northern tip of Sumatra , is regularly hit by quakes . <p/>In 2004 a massive tremor sparked a tsunami that killed 170 , 000 people in the province and tens of thousands more in countries around the Indian Ocean . <p/>In April last year an 8 . 6 - magnitude quake struck 431 kilometres off Banda Aceh , prompting an Indian Ocean - wide tsunami alert . <p/>Five people died and seven were injured in Aceh in the quake and following aftershocks . <p/>In September 2009 a major earthquake near Padang city on Sumatra killed more than 1000 people . <p/>Indonesia sits on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire'' where tectonic plates collide , causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity .",

Inf. Irham Waroiham . <p/>About 1,000 residents had taken shelter in a military field , 500 in a navy field , 500 in the yard of the Manokwari regent office and 7,000 others in Masni district , which lies just outside of Manokwari city . <p/>The Meteorology and Geophysics Agency had issued a tsunami alert , but it was revoked within an hour after it was determined the epicenter of the main quake had been within the mainland . <p/>Quakes centered well within the mainland do not pose the threat of a tsunami to Indonesia , but can still spread large waves to neighboring countries , such as Japan . <p/>Japan 's Meteorological Agency said tsunamis 10 to 40 centimeters in height swept into towns along the coast . <p/>The quakes were also felt in Sorong regency . <p/>The regency police spokesman Snr. Comr. Agus Rianto told The Jakarta Post the quakes had damaged 18 houses , injuring 11 residents . <p/>The latest quakes in Manokwari occurred on Oct. 10 , 2002 , the largest recorded at magnitude 7.6 , killing three people . <p/>Another strong quake hit in 1996 , triggering enormous waves that hammered into the north coastal area of Papua , as well as Sorong , Biak and Manokwari .",

S . Geological Survey . <p/>USGS measurements indicated at least 20 smaller earthquakes followed throughout the morning . <p/>The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported the quake began only one mile below ground level , which is why it was felt across the region . <p/>There were no immediate reports of damage , the newspaper said . <p/>But it woke people up . <p/>More than 60 people reported to USGS's \"Did you feel it ? \" site , with reports ranging from San Francisco and Oakland to Lake and Yuba counties . <p/>Others reported the shaking on Twitter . <p/>Tectonic Summary - Maacama Fault <p/>The Maacama Fault is mostly a right - lateral strike - slip fault that lies north of Santa Rosa and the immediate San Francisco Bay Area and extends as far north as Ukiah . <p/>It connects to the Rodgers Creek Fault through a complex set of faults between Santa Rosa and Healdsburg , and is thought to be the northward continuation of the Hayward - Rodgers Creek Fault System . <p/>The 2007 Working Group for California Earthquake Probability assigned a total slip rate on the Maacama Fault of approximately 9 mm / yr ( 1 / 3 inches / yr ) , based on the assumption that it continues the slip on the Hayward - Rodgers Creek Fault northward . <p/>The central and northern sections of the fault have been observed to accommodate approximately 7 mm / yr ( 1 / 4 inch / year ) of creep along it . <p/>The Maacama Fault parallels and overlaps the Rodgers Creek Fault , in a geometry that is causing the ground between the faults to subside . <p/>In Sonoma County north of Healdsburg , the Maacama Fault is largely obscured by massive landslides where it passes east of Alexander Valley . <p/>The 2007 Working Group for California Earthquake Probability combined the Maacama and the Garberville Faults into single a 181 - km ( 110 mile ) long fault and determined M7 . 5 as the maximum magnitude for this combined fault system . <p/>There is very little known about the seismic history or earthquake cycle of the Maacama Fault , and as such recurrence intervals are uncertain .",

\" <p/>The hope of a first female Doctor has once again been dashed , though Moffat tantalisingly hinted that the prospect remained for the future . <p/>\"Time Lords can change gender , so it is not against the rules , \" he said . <p/>Jenna Coleman , who will remain as the Doctor's companion when Capaldi takes over the role next year , said : \"With Steven's writing and his talent I know we'll be making an amazing show with an incredible incarnation of number 12 . <p/>I can't wait to start this new adventure . \" <p/>The decision was welcomed by Smith who pre - recorded a message to Capaldi , saying : \"I just want to wish my successor all the best and just say good luck and good on you for getting it , because I know he is both a huge fan of the show and a really nice guy . <p/>\"The casting of it made me really excited genuinely , and as a fan I think it's a really canny choice , so good luck mate , it's going to be a thrill . \" <p/>Smith added : \"If I had to pick someone , I'd pick him , because I think he's great . <p/>And weirdly enough , after the 11th hour , he came up to me in the street and said , 'Ah mate , well done . <p/>I watched your episode last night , it was brilliant , I think you're really good' . <p/>And I really needed that , I needed a sort of boost and I never forgot it . \" <p/>Capaldi has appeared in more than 40 films and TV shows , including Dangerous Liaisons , Shooting Fish , Minder , The Vicar of Dibley , Peep Show and Waking the Dead , since being cast as Danny Oldsen in the 1983 film Local Hero . <p/>He is also playing Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger in the forthcoming film about the WikiLeaks affair .",

  "marked_doc": "Apple on Tuesday launched a refresh of the 17-inch MacBook Pro , giving the company 's largest laptop an eight-hour battery life , a faster Intel ( NSDQ : INTC ) processor , and better <mark id=\"mark_id\"> graphics capabilities </mark> . <p/>The upgraded product was the only hardware announcement at the opening Macworld keynote , which was delivered by Phil Schiller , senior VP for worldwide product marketing at Apple . <p/>Breaking with tradition , the company announced late last month that co-founder and chief executive Steve Jobs would not kick off the trade show . <p/>In addition , Apple stunned the industry by saying this year would be its last appearance at Macworld . <p/>The absence of Jobs led many analysts to believe that Apple would not make any major product announcements , and the prediction turned out to be correct , particularly in terms of hardware . <p/>The MacBook was the only Apple computer to get an upgrade , which is sure to disappoint fans who had also hoped for updates to the company 's Mac Mini and Apple TV . <p/>Apple observers had expected the refresh of the 17-inch MacBook Pro , given that it was left out of Apple 's notebook event in October , when the company launched updates of the 15-inch and 13.3-inch systems . <p/>But while some analysts said the larger laptop could get a big speed boost with an Intel quad-core processor , Apple stuck with an Intel dual-core chip , which has been upgraded to a 2.66-GHz Core 2 Duo processor with 6 MB of on-chip L2 cache . <p/>Buyers also have the option of a 2.93-GHz Core 2 Duo processor . <p/>But the most innovative feature in the upgrade is a new battery that Apple claims will last up to eight hours on a single charge and can be recharged up to 1,000 times , which means up to a five-year lifespan . <p/>RivalsDell ( Dell ) and Hewlett-Packard ( NYSE : HPQ ) last year introduced laptops with similar battery life on a single charge . <p/>The Apple battery achieves its better performance by using custom-designed lithium-polymer cells that are 40 % larger than the previous generation . <p/>However , to fit the battery in the system , Apple has made it nonremovable , which may turn off some potential buyers . <p/>Because of the extended lifespan of the battery , Apple says the MacBook is more environmentally friendly than the previous generation , since the power supply does n't have to be replaced so often . <p/>The notebook is less than an inch thick , weighs 6.6 pounds , and features a light-emitting diode screen with a $ 50 anti-glare option . <p/>In addition , the system comes with an Nvidia GeForce 9400M integrated graphics processor and a discrete Nvidia 9600M GT processor . <p/>Switching to the latter gives better graphics performance at the expense of about an hour of battery life .",

'' <p/>The Israeli military however argued Hamas fighters had fired mortar shells at their forces from the school and they had to return fire . <p/>In the aftermath of the school attack , Tel Aviv decided to allow the establishment of a `` humanitarian corridor '' into the Gaza Strip , premier Ehud Olmert 's office said last night . <p/>Christopher Gunness , spokesman for the UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) described the situation on the ground to the EUobserver . <p/>Some 1 million Gazans are currently without electricity , another 250,000 are without running water , and every hospital is running on emergency generators . <p/>UNRWA hands out food to 750,000 people daily , but Mr Gunness warned that they will run out of food `` in days , rather than weeks '' , and there was no food distribution on Tuesday at all . <p/>Tzipi Livni , the Israeli foreign minister said several times last week that there is no humanitarian crisis in the occupied territory , and the Israeli ambassador to the EU yesterday told this website that Ms Livni had explained to the EU peace delegation on Monday: <p/>`` Everything is being done and will be done to avoid a humanitarian crisis . '' <p/>The UN 's Mr Gunness disagreed with the minister: <p/>`` There is a humanitarian crisis already , so she 's not managed to avoid one . '' <p/>`` It 's impossible to do our jobs. The reason we had to cancel food distribution today is because our trucking contractor had two relatives killed by the Israelis . <p/>There was a wake organised but then that was attacked too . <p/>It 's just too dangerous for them to be driving around . '' <p/>`` During the period of relative calm of about five-six months following the 19 July truce , we regularly asked to get aid in , but Israel did n't give permission . '' <p/>On 19 June 2008 , a six-month Egypt-brokered truce agreement was reached between Hamas and Israel . <p/>Tel Aviv however broke the cease-fire on 4 November 2008 , when Israeli troops raided the Gaza Strip and killed six Hamas gunmen . <p/>At the time , Israel claimed Hamas was planning to use a tunnel to capture Israeli soldiers . <p/>The truce completely broke down on 20 December , when Hamas officially announced that they would not be extending the cease-fire , and began launching rockets targetting southern Israel once again . <p/>Meanwhile , Egypt has put forward a truce plan that would include an immediate ceasefire , as well as meetings in Cairo between leaders of Israel and `` Palestinian factions , '' news wires report . <p/>Details of the proposal are not known yet , but its main focus is to halt the violence and secure borders between Gaza and Israel , as well as Gaza and Egypt - so as to limit arms smuggling from Egypt into the Gaza Strip . <p/>According to the BBC , both Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and the US have backed the proposal . <p/>Israel has said it would look into the suggestion . <p/>`` I am very sure it will be considered ... we take it very , very seriously , '' Gabriela Shalev , Israel 's ambassador to the UN , was quoted as saying by Reuters . <p/>More than 600 Palestinians have been killed so far in the 12 days of the Israeli offensive into Gaza , and around 3,000 have been wounded . <p/>Palestinian health ministry officials say at least 195 of the victims are children . <p/>Israel has so far lost seven soldiers and four civilians in the conflict . <p/>The EU has also warned Israel that the offensive was tarnishing its image , German news agency DPA reports . <p/>`` We have come to Israel in order to advance the initiative for a humanitarian ceasefire and I will tell you , Mr President , that you have a serious problem with international advocacy , and that Israel 's image is being destroyed , '' EU foreign affairs commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner told Israeli President Shimon Peres during the visit of an EU delegation in the region . <p/>But Mr Peres retorted that Israel was fighting other wars and a public image one was not among them . <p/>`` Europe must open its eyes . <p/>We are not in the business of public relations or improving our image . <p/>We are fighting against terror , and we have every right to defend our citizens , '' he told an EU ministerial delegation , AFP reports .",

'' <p/>The Israeli military however argued Hamas fighters had fired mortar shells at their forces from the school and they had to return fire . <p/>In the aftermath of the school attack , Tel Aviv decided to allow the establishment of a `` humanitarian corridor '' into the Gaza Strip , premier Ehud Olmert 's office said last night . <p/>Christopher Gunness , spokesman for the UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) described the situation on the ground to the EUobserver . <p/>Some 1 million Gazans are currently without electricity , another 250,000 are without running water , and every hospital is running on emergency generators . <p/>UNRWA hands out food to 750,000 people daily , but Mr Gunness warned that they will run out of food `` in days , rather than weeks '' , and there was no food distribution on Tuesday at all . <p/>Tzipi Livni , the Israeli foreign minister said several times last week that there is no humanitarian crisis in the occupied territory , and the Israeli ambassador to the EU yesterday told this website that Ms Livni had explained to the EU peace delegation on Monday: <p/>`` Everything is being done and will be done to avoid a humanitarian crisis . '' <p/>The UN 's Mr Gunness disagreed with the minister: <p/>`` There is a humanitarian crisis already , so she 's not managed to avoid one . '' <p/>`` It 's impossible to do our jobs. The reason we had to cancel food distribution today is because our trucking contractor had two relatives killed by the Israelis . <p/>There was a wake organised but then that was attacked too . <p/>It 's just too dangerous for them to be driving around . '' <p/>`` During the period of relative calm of about five-six months following the 19 July truce , we regularly asked to get aid in , but Israel did n't give permission . '' <p/>On 19 June 2008 , a six-month Egypt-brokered truce agreement was reached between Hamas and Israel . <p/>Tel Aviv however broke the cease-fire on 4 November 2008 , when Israeli troops raided the Gaza Strip and killed six Hamas gunmen . <p/>At the time , Israel claimed Hamas was planning to use a tunnel to capture Israeli soldiers . <p/>The truce completely broke down on 20 December , when Hamas officially announced that they would not be extending the cease-fire , and began launching rockets targetting southern Israel once again . <p/>Meanwhile , Egypt has put forward a truce plan that would include an immediate ceasefire , as well as meetings in Cairo between leaders of Israel and `` Palestinian factions , '' news wires report . <p/>Details of the proposal are not known yet , but its main focus is to halt the violence and secure borders between Gaza and Israel , as well as Gaza and Egypt - so as to limit arms smuggling from Egypt into the Gaza Strip . <p/>According to the BBC , both Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and the US have backed the proposal . <p/>Israel has said it would look into the suggestion . <p/>`` I am very sure it will be considered ... we take it very , very seriously , '' Gabriela Shalev , Israel 's ambassador to the UN , was quoted as saying by Reuters . <p/>More than 600 Palestinians have been killed so far in the 12 days of the Israeli offensive into Gaza , and around 3,000 have been wounded . <p/>Palestinian health ministry officials say at least 195 of the victims are children . <p/>Israel has so far lost seven soldiers and four civilians in the conflict . <p/>The EU has also warned Israel that the offensive was tarnishing its image , German news agency DPA reports . <p/>`` We have come to Israel in order to advance the initiative for a humanitarian ceasefire and I will tell you , Mr President , that you have a serious problem with international advocacy , and that Israel 's image is being destroyed , '' EU foreign affairs commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner told Israeli President Shimon Peres during the visit of an EU delegation in the region . <p/>But Mr Peres retorted that Israel was fighting other wars and a public image one was not among them . <p/>`` Europe must open its eyes . <p/>We are not in the business of public relations or improving our image . <p/>We are fighting against terror , and we have every right to defend our citizens , '' he told an EU ministerial delegation , AFP reports .",

'' <p/>On 19 June 2008 , a six-month Egypt-brokered truce agreement was reached between Hamas and Israel . <p/>Tel Aviv however broke the cease-fire on 4 November 2008 , when Israeli troops raided the Gaza Strip and killed six Hamas gunmen . <p/>At the time , Israel claimed Hamas was planning to use a tunnel to capture Israeli soldiers . <p/>The truce completely broke down on 20 December , when Hamas officially announced that they would not be extending the cease-fire , and began launching rockets targetting southern Israel once again . <p/>Meanwhile , Egypt has put forward a truce plan that would include an immediate ceasefire , as well as meetings in Cairo between leaders of Israel and `` Palestinian factions , '' news wires report . <p/>Details of the proposal are not known yet , but its main focus is to halt the violence and secure borders between Gaza and Israel , as well as Gaza and Egypt - so as to limit arms smuggling from Egypt into the Gaza Strip . <p/>According to the BBC , both Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and the US have backed the proposal . <p/>Israel has said it would look into the suggestion . <p/>`` I am very sure it will be considered ... we take it very , very seriously , '' Gabriela Shalev , Israel 's ambassador to the UN , was quoted as saying by Reuters . <p/>More than 600 Palestinians have been killed so far in the 12 days of the Israeli offensive into Gaza , and around 3,000 have been wounded . <p/>Palestinian health ministry officials say at least 195 of the victims are children . <p/>Israel has so far lost seven soldiers and four civilians in the conflict . <p/>The EU has also warned Israel that the offensive was tarnishing its image , German news agency DPA reports . <p/>`` We have come to Israel in order to advance the initiative for a humanitarian ceasefire and I will tell you , Mr President , that you have a serious problem with international advocacy , and that Israel 's image is being destroyed , '' EU foreign affairs commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner told Israeli President Shimon Peres during the visit of an EU delegation in the region . <p/>But Mr Peres retorted that Israel was fighting other wars and a public image one was not among them . <p/>`` Europe must open its eyes . <p/>We are not in the business of public relations or improving our image . <p/>We are fighting against terror , and we have every right to defend our citizens , '' he told an EU ministerial delegation , AFP reports .",

  "marked_doc": "The civilian <mark id=\"mark_id\"> death toll </mark> in Gaza increased dramatically today , with reports of more than 40 Palestinians killed after missiles exploded outside a UN school where hundreds of people were sheltering from the continuing Israeli offensive . <p/>Two Israeli tank shells struck the school in Jabaliya refugee camp , spraying shrapnel on people inside and outside the building , according to news agency reports . <p/>The medical director of the hospital in Jabaliya told the Guardian 41 bodies had been brought in so far and more could be on the way . <p/>Reuters journalists filmed bodies scattered on the ground amid pools of blood and torn shoes and clothes . <p/>In addition to the dead , several dozen people were wounded , hospital officials said . <p/>The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports . <p/>A United Nations official in Gaza said the school was clearly marked with a UN flag and its location had been reported to Israeli authorities . <p/>John Ging , director of operations in Gaza for UNRWA , the United Nations Relief and Works Agency , said that three artillery shells landed at the perimeter of the school where 350 people were taking shelter . <p/>`` Of course it was entirely inevitable if artillery shells landed in that area there would be a high number of casualties , '' he said . <p/>Asked whether there were Hamas militants in the area at the time of the attack , Ging said it was the scene of clashes `` so there 's an intense military and militant activity in that area . '' <p/>He said UN staff vetted Palestinians seeking shelter at their facilities to make sure militants were not taking advantage of them. `` So far we 've not had violations by militants of our facilities , '' he said . <p/>Ging called for an independent investigation of the strikes near UN facilities . <p/>`` I saw a lot of women and children wheeled in , '' Fares Ghanem , a hospital official told the Associated Press . <p/>`` A lot of the wounded were missing limbs and a lot of the dead were in pieces . '' <p/>Majed Hamdan , an AP photographer , who rushed to the scene shortly after the attacks , said many children were among the dead . <p/>`` I saw women and men parents slapping their faces in grief , screaming , some of them collapsed to the floor . <p/>They knew their children were dead , '' he said . <p/>`` In the morgue , most of the killed appeared to be children . <p/>In the hospital , there was n't enough space for the wounded . '' <p/>Elsewehere , at least 12 members of an extended family , including seven young children , were killed in an air strike on their house in Gaza City . <p/>The bodies of the Daya family were pulled from the rubble of a house in Gaza city 's Zeitoun district after it was hit by two Israeli missiles . <p/>The dead included seven children aged from one to 12 years , three women and two men . <p/>Nine other people were believed to be trapped in the rubble . <p/>Hours earlier , three young men - all cousins - died when the Israelis bombed another UN school , the Asma primary school in Gaza City . <p/>They were among about 400 people who sought shelter there after fleeing their homes in Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza . <p/>The UN , which said the school in Jabaliya was clearly marked , said it was `` strongly protesting these killings to the Israeli authorities and is calling for an immediate and impartial investigation '' . <p/>`` Where it is found that international humanitarian law has been violated , those responsible must be held to account . <p/>Under international law , installations such as schools , health centres and UN facilities should be protected from attack . <p/>Well before the current fighting , the UN had given to the Israeli authorities the GPS co-ordinates of all its installations in Gaza , including Asma elementary school . '' <p/>The killings take the total toll in Palestinian lives since the Israelis launched their assault on the Gaza Strip 11 days ago to above 600 . <p/>Doctors at Gaza hospitals say that at least one-fifth of the victims are children and a large number of women are among the dead . <p/>Israel continues to insist that the bulk of those killed are Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters , although its claim to be going to extraordinary lengths to target only `` terrorists '' has been undermined by one of its own tanks firing on a building being used by Israeli troops , killing four . <p/>The sharp spike in the number of civilian casualties came as Israeli troops and tanks moved into Gaza 's second largest city , Khan Younis , for the first time today , supported by intensive artillery strikes as the military pledged to press on with its attack . <p/>In a separate attack earlier in the day , three Palestinians were killed in an air strike on another school run by Unwra , the UN relief agency . <p/>Nine Israelis , including three civilians hit by rocket fire , have been killed in the conflict . <p/>At least five rockets fired from Gaza landed in Israel today , including one that hit the town of Gadera , 17 miles from Tel Aviv , police said . <p/>A three-year-old girl was wounded . <p/>The heaviest fighting has been in northern Gaza , with witnesses reporting wave after wave of bombing strikes across the north of the territory accompanied by gunfire from helicopters and artillery from land and sea . <p/>Thousands of Palestinians have been ordered to leave their homes or forced to flee the fighting . <p/>In Shajaiyeh , east of Gaza City , Israeli troops seized control of three apartment blocks and set up gun positions on the rooftops . <p/>Residents were locked in their homes and soldiers confiscated their mobile phones , neighbours said . <p/>Three of the four Israeli soldiers killed by friendly fire died when a tank mistakenly fired on a building where the soldiers had taken up positions . <p/>There was heavy artillery fire to cover the evacuation of 24 soldiers who were injured , including the commander of the Golani infantry brigade , one of Israel 's key fighting forces . <p/>Israel 's defence minister , Ehud Barak , said his country 's troops would continue their operation despite mounting Palestinian casualties and growing international calls for a ceasefire . <p/>`` Hamas has so far sustained a very heavy blow from us , but we have yet to achieve our objective , and therefore the operation continues , '' Barak said . <p/>The Israeli foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , said the offensive was intended to change permanently the shape of Israel 's conflict with Hamas . <p/>`` When Israel is targeted , Israel is going to retaliate , '' she said . <p/>Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire . <p/>The military said it had bombed more smuggling tunnels across the border with Egypt , in the south , and hit more than 40 other sites across Gaza including buildings storing weapons and rocket launching areas . <p/>In Gaza , Mahmoud Zahar , the most senior leader of Hamas in the strip and a hardliner in the movement , appeared on the party 's al-Aqsa television station and gave a defiant speech threatening attacks not only in Gaza but elsewhere . <p/>`` The Zionists have legitimised the killing of their children by killing our children . <p/>They have legitimised the killing of their people all over the world by killing our people , '' Zahar said . <p/>He urged Hamas fighters to `` crush your enemy '' . <p/>Another Hamas figure , a recognised military spokesman called Abu Ubaida , said thousands of Hamas fighters were waiting in Gaza to take on the Israeli military , and that rocket attacks would increase . <p/>More than 40 were fired into southern Israel yesterday , including one that landed in an empty kindergarten , which , like all schools near the Gaza border , has been closed since the conflict began . <p/>Israeli police said a total of 520 rockets had been fired in the past 11 days of fighting . <p/>Israeli troops are now deployed in and around the major urban areas of Gaza , particularly to the north , in Beit Hanoun , Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya . <p/>Using leaflets , telephone calls and radio announcements , they have ordered residents in many areas to leave their homes , forcing at least 15,000 Palestinians to flee to safety elsewhere . <p/>At least 5,000 are staying in 11 different UN schools and shelters . <p/>The UN said more than 1 million Gazans were still without electricity or water and that it was increasingly difficult for staff to distribute aid or reach the injured . <p/>It said more industrial diesel was needed to reopen the strip 's sole power plant , which has been shut for a week . <p/>Ten transformers have been damaged in the fighting . <p/>More wheat grain is needed for food handouts , and the UN said Karni , the main commercial crossing , should be reopened to allow it in . <p/>Four ambulances and three mobile clinics were destroyed when bombs hit the headquarters of the Union of Health Care Committees in Gaza City . <p/>John Holmes , the UN emergency relief coordinator , said Gaza represented an `` increasingly alarming '' humanitarian crisis , and that the territory was running low on clean water , power , food , medicine and other supplies since Israel began its offensive . <p/>Israeli leaders claim there is no humanitarian crisis .",

'' <p/>Majed Hamdan , an AP photographer , who rushed to the scene shortly after the attacks , said many children were among the dead . <p/>`` I saw women and men parents slapping their faces in grief , screaming , some of them collapsed to the floor . <p/>They knew their children were dead , '' he said . <p/>`` In the morgue , most of the killed appeared to be children . <p/>In the hospital , there was n't enough space for the wounded . '' <p/>Elsewehere , at least 12 members of an extended family , including seven young children , were killed in an air strike on their house in Gaza City . <p/>The bodies of the Daya family were pulled from the rubble of a house in Gaza city 's Zeitoun district after it was hit by two Israeli missiles . <p/>The dead included seven children aged from one to 12 years , three women and two men . <p/>Nine other people were believed to be trapped in the rubble . <p/>Hours earlier , three young men - all cousins - died when the Israelis bombed another UN school , the Asma primary school in Gaza City . <p/>They were among about 400 people who sought shelter there after fleeing their homes in Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza . <p/>The UN , which said the school in Jabaliya was clearly marked , said it was `` strongly protesting these killings to the Israeli authorities and is calling for an immediate and impartial investigation '' . <p/>`` Where it is found that international humanitarian law has been violated , those responsible must be held to account . <p/>Under international law , installations such as schools , health centres and UN facilities should be protected from attack . <p/>Well before the current fighting , the UN had given to the Israeli authorities the GPS co-ordinates of all its installations in Gaza , including Asma elementary school . '' <p/>The killings take the total toll in Palestinian lives since the Israelis launched their assault on the Gaza Strip 11 days ago to above 600 . <p/>Doctors at Gaza hospitals say that at least one-fifth of the victims are children and a large number of women are among the dead . <p/>Israel continues to insist that the bulk of those killed are Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters , although its claim to be going to extraordinary lengths to target only `` terrorists '' has been undermined by one of its own tanks firing on a building being used by Israeli troops , killing four . <p/>The sharp spike in the number of civilian casualties came as Israeli troops and tanks moved into Gaza 's second largest city , Khan Younis , for the first time today , supported by intensive artillery strikes as the military pledged to press on with its attack . <p/>In a separate attack earlier in the day , three Palestinians were killed in an air strike on another school run by Unwra , the UN relief agency . <p/>Nine Israelis , including three civilians hit by rocket fire , have been killed in the conflict . <p/>At least five rockets fired from Gaza landed in Israel today , including one that hit the town of Gadera , 17 miles from Tel Aviv , police said . <p/>A three-year-old girl was wounded . <p/>The heaviest fighting has been in northern Gaza , with witnesses reporting wave after wave of bombing strikes across the north of the territory accompanied by gunfire from helicopters and artillery from land and sea . <p/>Thousands of Palestinians have been ordered to leave their homes or forced to flee the fighting . <p/>In Shajaiyeh , east of Gaza City , Israeli troops seized control of three apartment blocks and set up gun positions on the rooftops . <p/>Residents were locked in their homes and soldiers confiscated their mobile phones , neighbours said . <p/>Three of the four Israeli soldiers killed by friendly fire died when a tank mistakenly fired on a building where the soldiers had taken up positions . <p/>There was heavy artillery fire to cover the evacuation of 24 soldiers who were injured , including the commander of the Golani infantry brigade , one of Israel 's key fighting forces . <p/>Israel 's defence minister , Ehud Barak , said his country 's troops would continue their operation despite mounting Palestinian casualties and growing international calls for a ceasefire . <p/>`` Hamas has so far sustained a very heavy blow from us , but we have yet to achieve our objective , and therefore the operation continues , '' Barak said . <p/>The Israeli foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , said the offensive was intended to change permanently the shape of Israel 's conflict with Hamas . <p/>`` When Israel is targeted , Israel is going to retaliate , '' she said . <p/>Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire . <p/>The military said it had bombed more smuggling tunnels across the border with Egypt , in the south , and hit more than 40 other sites across Gaza including buildings storing weapons and rocket launching areas . <p/>In Gaza , Mahmoud Zahar , the most senior leader of Hamas in the strip and a hardliner in the movement , appeared on the party 's al-Aqsa television station and gave a defiant speech threatening attacks not only in Gaza but elsewhere . <p/>`` The Zionists have legitimised the killing of their children by killing our children . <p/>They have legitimised the killing of their people all over the world by killing our people , '' Zahar said . <p/>He urged Hamas fighters to `` crush your enemy '' . <p/>Another Hamas figure , a recognised military spokesman called Abu Ubaida , said thousands of Hamas fighters were waiting in Gaza to take on the Israeli military , and that rocket attacks would increase . <p/>More than 40 were fired into southern Israel yesterday , including one that landed in an empty kindergarten , which , like all schools near the Gaza border , has been closed since the conflict began . <p/>Israeli police said a total of 520 rockets had been fired in the past 11 days of fighting . <p/>Israeli troops are now deployed in and around the major urban areas of Gaza , particularly to the north , in Beit Hanoun , Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya . <p/>Using leaflets , telephone calls and radio announcements , they have ordered residents in many areas to leave their homes , forcing at least 15,000 Palestinians to flee to safety elsewhere . <p/>At least 5,000 are staying in 11 different UN schools and shelters . <p/>The UN said more than 1 million Gazans were still without electricity or water and that it was increasingly difficult for staff to distribute aid or reach the injured . <p/>It said more industrial diesel was needed to reopen the strip 's sole power plant , which has been shut for a week . <p/>Ten transformers have been damaged in the fighting . <p/>More wheat grain is needed for food handouts , and the UN said Karni , the main commercial crossing , should be reopened to allow it in . <p/>Four ambulances and three mobile clinics were destroyed when bombs hit the headquarters of the Union of Health Care Committees in Gaza City . <p/>John Holmes , the UN emergency relief coordinator , said Gaza represented an `` increasingly alarming '' humanitarian crisis , and that the territory was running low on clean water , power , food , medicine and other supplies since Israel began its offensive . <p/>Israeli leaders claim there is no humanitarian crisis .",

'' <p/>Elsewehere , at least 12 members of an extended family , including seven young children , were killed in an air strike on their house in Gaza City . <p/>The bodies of the Daya family were pulled from the rubble of a house in Gaza city 's Zeitoun district after it was hit by two Israeli missiles . <p/>The dead included seven children aged from one to 12 years , three women and two men . <p/>Nine other people were believed to be trapped in the rubble . <p/>Hours earlier , three young men - all cousins - died when the Israelis bombed another UN school , the Asma primary school in Gaza City . <p/>They were among about 400 people who sought shelter there after fleeing their homes in Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza . <p/>The UN , which said the school in Jabaliya was clearly marked , said it was `` strongly protesting these killings to the Israeli authorities and is calling for an immediate and impartial investigation '' . <p/>`` Where it is found that international humanitarian law has been violated , those responsible must be held to account . <p/>Under international law , installations such as schools , health centres and UN facilities should be protected from attack . <p/>Well before the current fighting , the UN had given to the Israeli authorities the GPS co-ordinates of all its installations in Gaza , including Asma elementary school . '' <p/>The killings take the total toll in Palestinian lives since the Israelis launched their assault on the Gaza Strip 11 days ago to above 600 . <p/>Doctors at Gaza hospitals say that at least one-fifth of the victims are children and a large number of women are among the dead . <p/>Israel continues to insist that the bulk of those killed are Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters , although its claim to be going to extraordinary lengths to target only `` terrorists '' has been undermined by one of its own tanks firing on a building being used by Israeli troops , killing four . <p/>The sharp spike in the number of civilian casualties came as Israeli troops and tanks moved into Gaza 's second largest city , Khan Younis , for the first time today , supported by intensive artillery strikes as the military pledged to press on with its attack . <p/>In a separate attack earlier in the day , three Palestinians were killed in an air strike on another school run by Unwra , the UN relief agency . <p/>Nine Israelis , including three civilians hit by rocket fire , have been killed in the conflict . <p/>At least five rockets fired from Gaza landed in Israel today , including one that hit the town of Gadera , 17 miles from Tel Aviv , police said . <p/>A three-year-old girl was wounded . <p/>The heaviest fighting has been in northern Gaza , with witnesses reporting wave after wave of bombing strikes across the north of the territory accompanied by gunfire from helicopters and artillery from land and sea . <p/>Thousands of Palestinians have been ordered to leave their homes or forced to flee the fighting . <p/>In Shajaiyeh , east of Gaza City , Israeli troops seized control of three apartment blocks and set up gun positions on the rooftops . <p/>Residents were locked in their homes and soldiers confiscated their mobile phones , neighbours said . <p/>Three of the four Israeli soldiers killed by friendly fire died when a tank mistakenly fired on a building where the soldiers had taken up positions . <p/>There was heavy artillery fire to cover the evacuation of 24 soldiers who were injured , including the commander of the Golani infantry brigade , one of Israel 's key fighting forces . <p/>Israel 's defence minister , Ehud Barak , said his country 's troops would continue their operation despite mounting Palestinian casualties and growing international calls for a ceasefire . <p/>`` Hamas has so far sustained a very heavy blow from us , but we have yet to achieve our objective , and therefore the operation continues , '' Barak said . <p/>The Israeli foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , said the offensive was intended to change permanently the shape of Israel 's conflict with Hamas . <p/>`` When Israel is targeted , Israel is going to retaliate , '' she said . <p/>Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire . <p/>The military said it had bombed more smuggling tunnels across the border with Egypt , in the south , and hit more than 40 other sites across Gaza including buildings storing weapons and rocket launching areas . <p/>In Gaza , Mahmoud Zahar , the most senior leader of Hamas in the strip and a hardliner in the movement , appeared on the party 's al-Aqsa television station and gave a defiant speech threatening attacks not only in Gaza but elsewhere . <p/>`` The Zionists have legitimised the killing of their children by killing our children . <p/>They have legitimised the killing of their people all over the world by killing our people , '' Zahar said . <p/>He urged Hamas fighters to `` crush your enemy '' . <p/>Another Hamas figure , a recognised military spokesman called Abu Ubaida , said thousands of Hamas fighters were waiting in Gaza to take on the Israeli military , and that rocket attacks would increase . <p/>More than 40 were fired into southern Israel yesterday , including one that landed in an empty kindergarten , which , like all schools near the Gaza border , has been closed since the conflict began . <p/>Israeli police said a total of 520 rockets had been fired in the past 11 days of fighting . <p/>Israeli troops are now deployed in and around the major urban areas of Gaza , particularly to the north , in Beit Hanoun , Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya . <p/>Using leaflets , telephone calls and radio announcements , they have ordered residents in many areas to leave their homes , forcing at least 15,000 Palestinians to flee to safety elsewhere . <p/>At least 5,000 are staying in 11 different UN schools and shelters . <p/>The UN said more than 1 million Gazans were still without electricity or water and that it was increasingly difficult for staff to distribute aid or reach the injured . <p/>It said more industrial diesel was needed to reopen the strip 's sole power plant , which has been shut for a week . <p/>Ten transformers have been damaged in the fighting . <p/>More wheat grain is needed for food handouts , and the UN said Karni , the main commercial crossing , should be reopened to allow it in . <p/>Four ambulances and three mobile clinics were destroyed when bombs hit the headquarters of the Union of Health Care Committees in Gaza City . <p/>John Holmes , the UN emergency relief coordinator , said Gaza represented an `` increasingly alarming '' humanitarian crisis , and that the territory was running low on clean water , power , food , medicine and other supplies since Israel began its offensive . <p/>Israeli leaders claim there is no humanitarian crisis .",

the town of Gadera , 17 miles from Tel Aviv , police said . <p/>A three-year-old girl was wounded . <p/>The heaviest fighting has been in northern Gaza , with witnesses reporting wave after wave of bombing strikes across the north of the territory accompanied by gunfire from helicopters and artillery from land and sea . <p/>Thousands of Palestinians have been ordered to leave their homes or forced to flee the fighting . <p/>In Shajaiyeh , east of Gaza City , Israeli troops seized control of three apartment blocks and set up gun positions on the rooftops . <p/>Residents were locked in their homes and soldiers confiscated their mobile phones , neighbours said . <p/>Three of the four Israeli soldiers killed by friendly fire died when a tank mistakenly fired on a building where the soldiers had taken up positions . <p/>There was heavy artillery fire to cover the evacuation of 24 soldiers who were injured , including the commander of the Golani infantry brigade , one of Israel 's key fighting forces . <p/>Israel 's defence minister , Ehud Barak , said his country 's troops would continue their operation despite mounting Palestinian casualties and growing international calls for a ceasefire . <p/>`` Hamas has so far sustained a very heavy blow from us , but we have yet to achieve our objective , and therefore the operation continues , '' Barak said . <p/>The Israeli foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , said the offensive was intended to change permanently the shape of Israel 's conflict with Hamas . <p/>`` When Israel is targeted , Israel is going to retaliate , '' she said . <p/>Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire . <p/>The military said it had bombed more smuggling tunnels across the border with Egypt , in the south , and hit more than 40 other sites across Gaza including buildings storing weapons and rocket launching areas . <p/>In Gaza , Mahmoud Zahar , the most senior leader of Hamas in the strip and a hardliner in the movement , appeared on the party 's al-Aqsa television station and gave a defiant speech threatening attacks not only in Gaza but elsewhere . <p/>`` The Zionists have legitimised the killing of their children by killing our children . <p/>They have legitimised the killing of their people all over the world by killing our people , '' Zahar said . <p/>He urged Hamas fighters to `` crush your enemy '' . <p/>Another Hamas figure , a recognised military spokesman called Abu Ubaida , said thousands of Hamas fighters were waiting in Gaza to take on the Israeli military , and that rocket attacks would increase . <p/>More than 40 were fired into southern Israel yesterday , including one that landed in an empty kindergarten , which , like all schools near the Gaza border , has been closed since the conflict began . <p/>Israeli police said a total of 520 rockets had been fired in the past 11 days of fighting . <p/>Israeli troops are now deployed in and around the major urban areas of Gaza , particularly to the north , in Beit Hanoun , Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya . <p/>Using leaflets , telephone calls and radio announcements , they have ordered residents in many areas to leave their homes , forcing at least 15,000 Palestinians to flee to safety elsewhere . <p/>At least 5,000 are staying in 11 different UN schools and shelters . <p/>The UN said more than 1 million Gazans were still without electricity or water and that it was increasingly difficult for staff to distribute aid or reach the injured . <p/>It said more industrial diesel was needed to reopen the strip 's sole power plant , which has been shut for a week . <p/>Ten transformers have been damaged in the fighting . <p/>More wheat grain is needed for food handouts , and the UN said Karni , the main commercial crossing , should be reopened to allow it in . <p/>Four ambulances and three mobile clinics were destroyed when bombs hit the headquarters of the Union of Health Care Committees in Gaza City . <p/>John Holmes , the UN emergency relief coordinator , said Gaza represented an `` increasingly alarming '' humanitarian crisis , and that the territory was running low on clean water , power , food , medicine and other supplies since Israel began its offensive . <p/>Israeli leaders claim there is no humanitarian crisis .",

  "marked_doc": "The civilian death toll in Gaza increased dramatically today , with reports of more than 40 Palestinians killed after missiles exploded outside a UN school where hundreds of people were sheltering from the continuing Israeli offensive . <p/>Two Israeli tank shells struck the school in Jabaliya refugee camp , spraying shrapnel on people inside and outside the building , according to news agency <mark id=\"mark_id\"> reports </mark> . <p/>The medical director of the hospital in Jabaliya told the Guardian 41 bodies had been brought in so far and more could be on the way . <p/>Reuters journalists filmed bodies scattered on the ground amid pools of blood and torn shoes and clothes . <p/>In addition to the dead , several dozen people were wounded , hospital officials said . <p/>The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports . <p/>A United Nations official in Gaza said the school was clearly marked with a UN flag and its location had been reported to Israeli authorities . <p/>John Ging , director of operations in Gaza for UNRWA , the United Nations Relief and Works Agency , said that three artillery shells landed at the perimeter of the school where 350 people were taking shelter . <p/>`` Of course it was entirely inevitable if artillery shells landed in that area there would be a high number of casualties , '' he said . <p/>Asked whether there were Hamas militants in the area at the time of the attack , Ging said it was the scene of clashes `` so there 's an intense military and militant activity in that area . '' <p/>He said UN staff vetted Palestinians seeking shelter at their facilities to make sure militants were not taking advantage of them. `` So far we 've not had violations by militants of our facilities , '' he said . <p/>Ging called for an independent investigation of the strikes near UN facilities . <p/>`` I saw a lot of women and children wheeled in , '' Fares Ghanem , a hospital official told the Associated Press . <p/>`` A lot of the wounded were missing limbs and a lot of the dead were in pieces . '' <p/>Majed Hamdan , an AP photographer , who rushed to the scene shortly after the attacks , said many children were among the dead . <p/>`` I saw women and men parents slapping their faces in grief , screaming , some of them collapsed to the floor . <p/>They knew their children were dead , '' he said . <p/>`` In the morgue , most of the killed appeared to be children . <p/>In the hospital , there was n't enough space for the wounded . '' <p/>Elsewehere , at least 12 members of an extended family , including seven young children , were killed in an air strike on their house in Gaza City . <p/>The bodies of the Daya family were pulled from the rubble of a house in Gaza city 's Zeitoun district after it was hit by two Israeli missiles . <p/>The dead included seven children aged from one to 12 years , three women and two men . <p/>Nine other people were believed to be trapped in the rubble . <p/>Hours earlier , three young men - all cousins - died when the Israelis bombed another UN school , the Asma primary school in Gaza City . <p/>They were among about 400 people who sought shelter there after fleeing their homes in Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza . <p/>The UN , which said the school in Jabaliya was clearly marked , said it was `` strongly protesting these killings to the Israeli authorities and is calling for an immediate and impartial investigation '' . <p/>`` Where it is found that international humanitarian law has been violated , those responsible must be held to account . <p/>Under international law , installations such as schools , health centres and UN facilities should be protected from attack . <p/>Well before the current fighting , the UN had given to the Israeli authorities the GPS co-ordinates of all its installations in Gaza , including Asma elementary school . '' <p/>The killings take the total toll in Palestinian lives since the Israelis launched their assault on the Gaza Strip 11 days ago to above 600 . <p/>Doctors at Gaza hospitals say that at least one-fifth of the victims are children and a large number of women are among the dead . <p/>Israel continues to insist that the bulk of those killed are Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters , although its claim to be going to extraordinary lengths to target only `` terrorists '' has been undermined by one of its own tanks firing on a building being used by Israeli troops , killing four . <p/>The sharp spike in the number of civilian casualties came as Israeli troops and tanks moved into Gaza 's second largest city , Khan Younis , for the first time today , supported by intensive artillery strikes

  "marked_doc": "The civilian death toll in Gaza increased dramatically today , with reports of more than 40 Palestinians killed after missiles exploded outside a UN school where hundreds of people were sheltering from the continuing Israeli offensive . <p/>Two Israeli tank shells struck the school in Jabaliya refugee camp , spraying shrapnel on people inside and outside the building , according to news agency reports . <p/>The medical director of the hospital in Jabaliya told the Guardian 41 bodies had been brought in so far and more could be on the way . <p/>Reuters journalists filmed bodies scattered on the ground amid pools of blood and torn shoes and clothes . <p/>In addition to the dead , several dozen people were wounded , hospital officials said . <p/>The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports . <p/>A United Nations official in Gaza said the school was clearly marked with a UN flag and its location had been reported to Israeli authorities . <p/>John Ging , director of operations in Gaza for UNRWA , the United Nations Relief and Works Agency , said that three artillery shells landed at the perimeter of the school where 350 people were taking shelter . <p/>`` Of course it was entirely inevitable if artillery shells landed in that area there would be a high number of casualties , '' he said . <p/>Asked whether there were Hamas militants in the area at the time of the attack , Ging said it was the scene of clashes `` so there 's an intense military and militant activity in that area . '' <p/>He said UN staff vetted Palestinians seeking shelter at their facilities to make sure militants were not taking advantage of them. `` So far we 've not had violations by militants of our facilities , '' he said . <p/>Ging called for an independent investigation of the strikes near UN facilities . <p/>`` I saw a lot of women and children wheeled in , '' Fares Ghanem , a hospital official told the Associated Press . <p/>`` A lot of the wounded were missing limbs and a lot of the dead were in pieces . '' <p/>Majed Hamdan , an AP photographer , who rushed to the scene shortly after the attacks , <mark id=\"mark_id\"> said </mark> many children were among the dead . <p/>`` I saw women and men parents slapping their faces in grief , screaming , some of them collapsed to the floor . <p/>They knew their children were dead , '' he said . <p/>`` In the morgue , most of the killed appeared to be children . <p/>In the hospital , there was n't enough space for the wounded . '' <p/>Elsewehere , at least 12 members of an extended family , including seven young children , were killed in an air strike on their house in Gaza City . <p/>The bodies of the Daya family were pulled from the rubble of a house in Gaza city 's Zeitoun district after it was hit by two Israeli missiles . <p/>The dead included seven children aged from one to 12 years , three women and two men . <p/>Nine other people were believed to be trapped in the rubble . <p/>Hours earlier , three young men - all cousins - died when the Israelis bombed another UN school , the Asma primary school in Gaza City . <p/>They were among about 400 people who sought shelter there after fleeing their homes in Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza . <p/>The UN , which said the school in Jabaliya was clearly marked , said it was `` strongly protesting these killings to the Israeli authorities and is calling for an immediate and impartial investigation '' . <p/>`` Where it is found that international humanitarian law has been violated , those responsible must be held to account . <p/>Under international law , installations such as schools , health centres and UN facilities should be protected from attack . <p/>Well before the current fighting , the UN had given to the Israeli authorities the GPS co-ordinates of all its installations in Gaza , including Asma elementary school . '' <p/>The killings take the total toll in Palestinian lives since the Israelis launched their assault on the Gaza Strip 11 days ago to above 600 . <p/>Doctors at Gaza hospitals say that at least one-fifth of the victims are children and a large number of women are among the dead . <p/>Israel continues to insist that the bulk of those killed are Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters , although its claim to be going to extraordinary lengths to target only `` terrorists '' has been undermined by one of its own tanks firing on a building being used by Israeli troops , killing four . <p/>The sharp spike in the number of civilian casualties came as Israeli troops and tanks moved into Gaza 's second largest city , Khan Younis , for the first time today , supported by intensive artillery strikes as the military pledged to press on with its attack . <p/>In a separate attack earlier in the day , three Palestinians were killed in an air strike on another school run by Unwra , the UN relief agency . <p/>Nine Israelis , including three civilians hit by rocket fire , have been killed in the conflict . <p/>At least five rockets fired from Gaza landed in Israel today , including one that hit the town of Gadera , 17 miles from Tel Aviv , police said . <p/>A three-year-old girl was wounded . <p/>The heaviest fighting has been in northern Gaza , with witnesses reporting wave after wave of bombing strikes across the north of the territory accompanied by gunfire from helicopters and artillery from land and sea . <p/>Thousands of Palestinians have been ordered to leave their homes or forced to flee the fighting . <p/>In Shajaiyeh , east of Gaza City , Israeli troops seized control of three apartment blocks and set up gun positions on the rooftops . <p/>Residents were locked in their homes and soldiers confiscated their mobile phones , neighbours said . <p/>Three of the four Israeli soldiers killed by friendly fire died when a tank mistakenly fired on a building where the soldiers had taken up positions . <p/>There was heavy artillery fire to cover the evacuation of 24 soldiers who were injured , including the commander of the Golani infantry brigade , one of Israel 's key fighting forces . <p/>Israel 's defence minister , Ehud Barak , said his country 's troops would continue their operation despite mounting Palestinian casualties and growing international calls for a ceasefire . <p/>`` Hamas has so far sustained a very heavy blow from us , but we have yet to achieve our objective , and therefore the operation continues , '' Barak said . <p/>The Israeli foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , said the offensive was intended to change permanently the shape of Israel 's conflict with Hamas . <p/>`` When Israel is targeted , Israel is going to retaliate , '' she said . <p/>Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire . <p/>The military said it had bombed more smuggling tunnels across the border with Egypt , in the south , and hit more than 40 other sites across Gaza including buildings storing weapons and rocket launching areas . <p/>In Gaza , Mahmoud Zahar , the most senior leader of Hamas in the strip and a hardliner in the movement , appeared on the party 's al-Aqsa television station and gave a defiant speech threatening attacks not only in Gaza but elsewhere . <p/>`` The Zionists have legitimised the killing of their children by killing our children . <p/>They have legitimised the killing of their people all over the world by killing our people , '' Zahar said . <p/>He urged Hamas fighters to `` crush your enemy '' . <p/>Another Hamas figure , a recognised military spokesman called Abu Ubaida , said thousands of Hamas fighters were waiting in Gaza to take on the Israeli military , and that rocket attacks would increase . <p/>More than 40 were fired into southern Israel yesterday , including one that landed in an empty kindergarten , which , like all schools near the Gaza border , has been closed since the conflict began . <p/>Israeli police said a total of 520 rockets had been fired in the past 11 days of fighting . <p/>Israeli troops are now deployed in and around the major urban areas of Gaza , particularly to the north , in Beit Hanoun , Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya . <p/>Using leaflets , telephone calls and radio announcements , they have ordered residents in many areas to leave their homes , forcing at least

  "marked_doc": "THE UN has <mark id=\"mark_id\"> disputed </mark> claims that Hamas militants fired mortars from the Gaza school that has suffered the deadliest attack of the war with Israel . <p/>Three shells hit Fakhura , a girls elementary school in the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza , at about 3pm on Tuesday ( 12am yesterday ) , according to UN Relief and Works Agency spokesman Christopher Gunness . <p/>At least 43 people were killed and 55 wounded in the school , where hundreds of Palestinians had sought refuge from the fighting , pushing the Palestinian death toll above 680 since the conflict began on December 27 . <p/>Two people were killed when an artillery shell hit a UN school in the southern city of Khan Younis . <p/>Three people also died in an air strike on another UN school in Gaza City 's Shati refugee camp in the centre of the strip . <p/>The carnage appeared to intensify international efforts to arrange a ceasefire - just as deadly strikes on civilians in previous conflicts in Lebanon raised pressure on Israel to halt hostilities . <p/>Israel moved quickly to explain the attack on the Jabalya school , saying its forces had been fired on first . <p/>The casualties included Hamas militants Imad and Hassan Abu Askar , both of whom had fired mortar shells at troops from the school , military officials said . <p/>However , John Ging , the top UN refugee official in Gaza , said UN staff and Palestinian families in the school compound had been screened for weapons , and he disputed Israel 's claim that mortars were fired from inside . <p/>`` As far as we are concerned , that is not true , but if Israel has evidence of that they need to provide it to an independent inquiry , '' Mr Ging said . <p/>He added : `` There 's nowhere safe in Gaza . <p/>Everyone here is terrorised and traumatised . '' <p/>Speaking after an initial investigation last night , Mr Gunness denied militants were at the school: <p/>`` We are 99.9 per cent sure that there were no militants or militant activities in the school and the school compound . '' <p/>Mr Gunness said earlier that schools were clearly marked with a UN flag and that the GPS co-ordinates of all UN installations in Gaza had been given some time ago to the Israelis . <p/>He said UNRWA wanted an impartial probe of the Israeli shelling that could also determine whether militants had used the school for a mortar attack . <p/>Mohammad Awad , in hospital with shrapnel wounds to the legs and face , said he had come to the school with his family after his house was destroyed in the bombing of a neighbouring home of a Hamas leader . <p/>He and other men had been sitting in the schoolyard when shells hit the compound . <p/>`` I saw bodies flying and people torn to pieces , '' he said . <p/>Umm Ibrahim said she had lost an eight-year-old daughter and two sons , 11 and 14 . <p/>She had come to the school after a phone warning from the Israelis that the family house would be struck because one son was a Hamas militant . <p/>`` We escaped death in our house , but it pursued us to the school , '' she said . <p/>`` What can we do ? <p/>Where should we go ? '' <p/>Although Israel said its return fire landed outside the school , witnesses described a series of blasts , which Israeli officials said suggested militants had rigged the building with explosives . <p/>`` We face a very delicate situation where Hamas is using the citizens of Gaza as a protective vest , '' said military spokesman Brigadier General Avi Benayahu . <p/>The incident renewed questions about Israel 's ability to wage a precision war in densely populated Gaza even as its forces pushed deeper into the narrow coastal territory . <p/>Heavy clashes continued in the north yesterday and airstrikes across the densely populated coastal strip . <p/>An airstrike in the Gaza City neighbourhood of Zeitun , where much of the heavy fighting has taken place since ground forces invaded on Saturday , left one armed militant dead and three wounded , medics said . <p/>Clashes were continuing in Zeitun , and there were reports of airstrikes on the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah . <p/>One rocket made the deepest strike yet into Israel - about 32km from Tel Aviv .",

'' <p/>Speaking after an initial investigation last night , Mr Gunness denied militants were at the school: <p/>`` We are 99.9 per cent sure that there were no militants or militant activities in the school and the school compound . '' <p/>Mr Gunness said earlier that schools were clearly marked with a UN flag and that the GPS co-ordinates of all UN installations in Gaza had been given some time ago to the Israelis . <p/>He said UNRWA wanted an impartial probe of the Israeli shelling that could also determine whether militants had used the school for a mortar attack . <p/>Mohammad Awad , in hospital with shrapnel wounds to the legs and face , said he had come to the school with his family after his house was destroyed in the bombing of a neighbouring home of a Hamas leader . <p/>He and other men had been <mark id=\"mark_id\"> sitting </mark> in the schoolyard when shells hit the compound . <p/>`` I saw bodies flying and people torn to pieces , '' he said . <p/>Umm Ibrahim said she had lost an eight-year-old daughter and two sons , 11 and 14 . <p/>She had come to the school after a phone warning from the Israelis that the family house would be struck because one son was a Hamas militant . <p/>`` We escaped death in our house , but it pursued us to the school , '' she said . <p/>`` What can we do ? <p/>Where should we go ? '' <p/>Although Israel said its return fire landed outside the school , witnesses described a series of blasts , which Israeli officials said suggested militants had rigged the building with explosives . <p/>`` We face a very delicate situation where Hamas is using the citizens of Gaza as a protective vest , '' said military spokesman Brigadier General Avi Benayahu . <p/>The incident renewed questions about Israel 's ability to wage a precision war in densely populated Gaza even as its forces pushed deeper into the narrow coastal territory . <p/>Heavy clashes continued in the north yesterday and airstrikes across the densely populated coastal strip . <p/>An airstrike in the Gaza City neighbourhood of Zeitun , where much of the heavy fighting has taken place since ground forces invaded on Saturday , left one armed militant dead and three wounded , medics said . <p/>Clashes were continuing in Zeitun , and there were reports of airstrikes on the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah . <p/>One rocket made the deepest strike yet into Israel - about 32km from Tel Aviv .",
