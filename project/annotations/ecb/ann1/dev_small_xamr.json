  "marked_doc": "The Indian navy captured 23 pirates who threatened a merchant vessel in the lawless waters of the Gulf of Aden and a German naval helicopter <mark id=\"mark_id\"> thwarted </mark> another attack Saturday on a freighter being chased by speedboats off Yemen . <p/>The successes came days before Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was to ask the United Nations to authorize `` all necessary measures '' against increasingly bold Somalian pirates operating in one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes . <p/>An Indian navy ship , the INS Mysore , was escorting merchant ships in waters off Somalia 's coast Saturday when it received a distress call from seamen on board the MV Gibe , who said they were being fired on by two boats that were approaching fast . <p/>The Mysore and its helicopter sped to the scene , and the pirate boats attempted to escape when they saw them , according to a statement from the Indian government . <p/>Indian marine commandoes boarded the pirate boats and seized `` a substantial cache of arms and equipment , '' including seven AK-47 assault rifles , three machine guns , a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and other weapons , the statement said . <p/>They also found a GPS receiver and other equipment . <p/>The pirates were from Somalia and Yemen , two countries on the coast of the Gulf of Aden . <p/>The Gibe was flying an Ethiopian flag but little else was known about it , the Indian statement said . <p/>Last month , India 's navy drew criticism after sinking a Thai fishing trawler that had been commandeered hours earlier by pirates . <p/>At least one Thai crew member was killed in the attack , which the Indian navy had originally announced by saying it had sunk a pirate `` mother ship . '' <p/>The Indian navy defended its actions , saying it had fired in self-defense . <p/>Somali pirates have become increasingly brazen and recently seized a Saudi supertanker loaded with $ 100 million of crude oil . <p/>Many of the vessels are taken to pirate-controlled regions in Somalia , where they are held for ransom . <p/>It was not immediately clear what would happen to the pirates captured by the Indians , or where they would be taken . <p/>The statement said only that the prisoners and their weapons would be `` handed over to appropriate authorities ashore . '' <p/>Most foreign navies patrolling the Somali coast have been reluctant to detain suspects because of uncertainties over where they would face trial , since Somalia has no effective central government or legal system . <p/>Also on Saturday , a German military spokesman said a navy frigate had chased away pirates in speedboats pursuing an Ethiopian freighter off the coast of Yemen . <p/>The German frigate responded to a distress call from the freighter , and a helicopter took off from the deck to investigate . <p/>The pirates turned away from the freighter as the helicopter flew overhead , said the spokesman , who declined to give his name in line with military policy . <p/>An estimated 1,500 pirates are based in Somalia 's semiautonomous Puntland region , raking in millions of dollars . <p/>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will present a draft Security Council resolution next week asking the United Nations to authorize `` all necessary measures '' against piracy from Somalia . <p/>However , the commander of the U.S. Navy 's 5th Fleet expressed doubt Friday about the wisdom of launching attacks against Somali pirates on land , as the draft proposes . <p/>U.S. Vice Adm. Bill Gortney told reporters that it is difficult to identify pirates , and the potential for killing innocent civilians `` can not be overestimated . '' <p/>The threat of pirates recently prompted a German cruise ship to evacuate some 420 passengers and crew after the company decided not to risk their safety as the ship passed through the Gulf of Aden . <p/>The passengers and crew have rejoined the M/S Columbus - which is on a six-month round-the-world trip - in Oman 's port of Salalah after three days in Dubai , Hamburg-based cruise operator Hapag-Lloyd said Saturday . <p/>The ship and a limited crew made it through the gulf without incident , a company spokeswoman said ."

'' <p/>He said the ship the Tabar fired on was laden with ammunition . <p/>All sorts of vessels -- freight and cargo ships , cruise liners and private yachts -- have been attacked in the waters off Somalia . <p/>In many hijackings , pirates take the crew and passengers hostage and demand a ransom . <p/>Just this month , Somali pirates captured two Yemeni fishing boats and 22 Yemeni fishermen in the Gulf of Aden , Yemen 's official news agency SABA reported . <p/>A day earlier , the German cruise liner MS Columbus said it would fly its 246 passengers and most of its crew over the Gulf of Aden instead of through it to avoid any pirate attack . <p/>The United States is reportedly circulating a proposal in the U.N. Security Council that would allow military forces to enter Somali territory in `` hot pursuit '' of pirates . <p/>The Pentagon said Friday , however , that there are no plans for U.S. forces to go ashore in pursuit of pirates in Somalia ."

'' <p/>She said Ben and his wife grew up as neighbours on Hornby Island . <p/>`` That was how Ben and Linda knew each other . '' <p/>Ben attended school in his early years in White Rock but got most of his education in Victoria where his father worked for Broadcast News , which is now The Canadian Press . <p/>She said he travelled to China for awhile , where he studied Mandarin and was quite fluent . <p/>`` I was so incredibly impressed that he spoke Mandarin that that really stuck in my head , '' said O'Higgins . <p/>John Banky , Ben 's older brother , spoke briefly from the parents ' home Monday , alluding to his brother 's musical abilities . <p/>`` He spoke a few languages and could play any instrument made by man , '' said his brother . <p/>While the family tried to deal with the loss , Kirkpatrick made a brief appearance in court . <p/>His lawyer , Richard Fowler , told the court his client is on suicide watch at the North Fraser Pretrial Centre in Port Coquitlam . <p/>Fowler described conditions at the centre as unacceptable , saying his client is double-bunked with a man who is withdrawing from a drug addiction and the cell is cold . <p/>Much of B.C. is in the grips of a cold spell , with unusually cold temperatures in the Vancouver area that are well below freezing . <p/>Kirkpatrick , who has long grey hair flowing down to his shoulders and a long grey beard , was dressed in red , prison-issue coveralls . <p/>He stood quietly in the prisoner 's box listening to the proceedings . <p/>The sixty-one-year-old was arrested Friday , not long after Banky was shot to death . <p/>Outside court , Fowler said Kirkpatrick is `` not doing very well . '' <p/>`` He is placed in a double bunk with somebody who is withdrawing from drugs . <p/>He can not sleep . <p/>It 's freezing cold . <p/>The problem is that these institutions are too full .

Benjamin nominated to be surgeon general <p/>Posted July 20 , 2009 <p/>President Obama's choices to be the nation's top physician and top scientist are both hands - on practitioners with extensive leadership experience . <p/>On July 13 , Obama announced that he was <mark id=\"mark_id\"> nominating </mark> Regina M . Benjamin , MD , a family physician from southern Alabama , to be surgeon general . <p/>Dr . Benjamin , 52 , became the first woman and first African - American president of the Medical Assn . of the State of Alabama in 2002 . <p/>She also completed a term in June as chair of the AMA Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs and served on the AMA Board of Trustees from 1995 to 1998 , becoming the first physician under 40 to serve on the board in a non - resident role . <p/>On July 8 , Obama nominated Francis S . Collins , MD , PhD , as director of the National Institutes of Health . <p/>Dr . Collins , 59 , led the Human Genome Project - - an effort to sequence and map human genes , that concluded in 2003 . <p/>He left his position as director of the NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute in 2008 after 15 years but maintains a lab at the NIH's Bethesda , Md . , campus . <p/>Both nominees must first be confirmed by the Senate . <p/>AMA President J . James Rohack , MD , said Dr . Benjamin has an impressive list of accomplishments , including receiving a MacArthur Fellowship in 2008 , commonly known as the \"genius grant . \" <p/>But awards are not her main focus , he said . <p/>\"Dr . Benjamin's most important qualification for surgeon general is her deep commitment to her patients . \" <p/>Dr . Benjamin said in the White House Rose Garden announcement that the deaths of close relatives from preventable diseases drove her to focus on public health . <p/>\"My father died with diabetes and hypertension . <p/>My older brother , and only sibling , died at age 44 of HIV - related illness . <p/>My mother died of lung cancer , because as a young girl , she wanted to smoke just like her twin brother could . \" <p/>Dr . Collins' colleagues said he is a natural choice to head the primary federal agency for funding and conducting medical research because of his thoughtfulness , willingness to listen and experience as a spokesman for the genome mapping effort . <p/>\"He's a forceful personality , \" said Tom Murray , PhD , head of the Hastings Center , an independent bioethics research institute . <p/>\"He wants to hear from people who don't agree with him . \" <p/>Patients before profits <p/>If confirmed , Dr . Benjamin would be the nation's lead public health educator . <p/>Fellow physicians see the role as a good fit . <p/>Besides experience with family illnesses , Dr . Benjamin said she also was influenced by her medical school training under David Satcher , MD , PhD , who later became surgeon general , and others who focused on public health issues in underserved areas . <p/>Jorge Alsip , MD , the Alabama medical society's president , said Dr . Benjamin has seen how much patients in poor and rural areas appreciate her help . <p/>\"That can't help but affect you and make you want to do something for these people , \" said Dr . Alsip , an emergency physician who has known Dr . Benjamin for more than 15 years . <p/>Dr . Alsip also said Dr . Benjamin is tenacious . <p/>\"If Regina's in a fight , don't ever bet against her . \" <p/>She rebuilt her clinic in Bayou La Batre , Ala . , twice after hurricanes destroyed it and is rebuilding it a third time after a fire . <p/>Obama said his surgeon general pick has personally witnessed how the U . S . health system is broken . <p/>\"She's seen an increasing number of patients who've had health insurance their entire lives suddenly lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simply become too expensive . \" <p/>Dr . Benjamin lamented the difficulty some doctors face in caring for patients , regardless of ability to pay . <p/>\"It shouldn't be this expensive for Americans to get health care in this country , \" she said . <p/>Obama said Dr . Benjamin has forgone a salary when her clinic faced financial hardship . <p/>Jeff Terry , MD , chair of the AMA's Alabama delegation and a urologist , said Dr . Benjamin has proven herself through work in organized medicine and elsewhere . <p/>The two co - founded the young physicians section of the state medical society nearly two decades ago . <p/>Since then , she has held leadership positions in physician organizations and other groups . <p/>Dr . Benjamin is also probably more politically liberal than many physicians on Alabama's Gulf Coast , Dr . Terry said . <p/>\"Maybe President Obama saw a little of that in her . \" <p/>Both scientific and religious <p/>Obama lauded Dr . Collins' experience in the July 8 announcement . <p/>\"Dr . Collins is one of the top scientists in the world , and his groundbreaking work has changed the very ways we consider our health and examine disease . \" <p/>Dr . Collins' laboratory discovered several important genes , including those responsible for cystic fibrosis and Huntington's disease . <p/>Acquaintances and colleagues predicted that Dr . Collins would do a good job representing NIH in front of lawmakers and others . <p/>He is a very approachable person who doesn't rely on jargon to communicate , said Sean B . Tipton , spokesman for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine . <p/>\"He has an ability to interact with the public and with policymakers and the press that I think will serve him very well as an NIH director . \" <p/>The Hastings Center's Murray said that if Dr . Collins ever made a mistake , it may be that he was a bit overly enthusiastic when describing the potential for breakthroughs when he was leading the Human Genome Project . <p/>Still , \"I can't fault the scientist who really believes in their work for being enthusiastic as they talk to Congress , \" Murray said . <p/>Dr . Collins has garnered attention by professing that his belief in God can coexist with his pursuit of science . <p/>He's written books on the topic , including the 2007 best - seller The Language of God : A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief . <p/>He is also founder and president of the BioLogos Foundation , whose purpose is to find compatibility between the scientific and religious searches for truth . <p/>In an interview with the spiritual Web site Beliefnet in 2007 , Dr . Collins said Christians who reject scientific evolutionary theory are also rejecting humans' ability to understand , a God - given skill . <p/>But there are limits to the questions science can answer , such as why we are here or what happens after death , he said . <p/>William Hurlbut , MD , a consulting professor of neuroscience at Stanford University and a former member of President George W . Bush's Council on Bioethics , said the idea that science and religion can't coexist is ridiculous . <p/>\"A person with Francis' background is a very wise choice\" for NIH chief , he said ."

Regina Benjamin : <mark id=\"mark_id\"> Nominee </mark> for Surgeon General <p/>July 13 , 2009 12 : 49 PM EDT <p/>The President announced his nominee for the U . S . Surgeon General , Dr . Regina Benjamin , today at the White House . <p/>Dr . Benjamin has an extensive and distinguished career in medicine . <p/>She is the Founder and CEO of the Bayou La Batre Rural Health Clinic in Alabama , which aims to provide primary care to people of any age regardless of their financial situation . <p/>She previously served as Chair of the Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States , and as the Associate Dean for Rural Health at the University of South Alabama College of Medicine . <p/>Additionally , she was chosen as President of the Medical Association of Alabama in 2002 , becoming the first African - American woman to be president of a state medical society . <p/>She was also the first African - American woman and physician under 40 to be elected to the American Medical Association Board of Trustees . <p/>She received the Nelson Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights in 1998 , among other honors . <p/>The President emphasized this experience in his remarks , chronicling her dedication to providing health care for her rural community in the face of adversity : <p/>And that's why , even though she could have left the state to make more money as a specialist or as a doctor in a wealthier community , Regina Benjamin returned to Alabama and opened a small clinic in Bayou La Batre . <p/>When people couldn't pay , she didn't charge them . <p/>When the clinic wasn't making money , she didn't take a salary for herself . <p/>When Hurricane George destroyed the clinic in 1998 , she made house calls to all her patients while it was rebuilt . <p/>When Hurricane Katrina destroyed it again and left most of her town homeless , she mortgaged her house and maxed out her credit cards to rebuild that clinic for a second time . <p/>She tended to those who had been wounded in the storm , and when folks needed medicine , she asked the pharmacist to send the bill her way . <p/>And when Regina's clinic was about to open for the third time , and a fire burned it to the ground before it could serve the first patient , well , you can guess what Dr . Benjamin did . <p/>With help from her community , she is rebuilding it again . <p/>One disabled patient brought her an envelope with $20 inside . <p/>Another elderly man said simply , \"Maybe I can help . <p/>I got a hammer . \" <p/>For nearly two decades , Dr . Regina Benjamin has seen in a very personal way what is broken about our health care system . <p/>She's seen an increasing number of patients who've had health insurance their entire lives suddenly lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simply become too expensive . <p/>She's been a relentless promoter of prevention and wellness programs , having treated too many costly and - - diseases and complications that didn't have to happen . <p/>And she's witnessed the shortage of primary care physicians in the rural and underserved areas where she works . <p/>But for all that she's seen and all the tremendous obstacles that she has overcome , Regina Benjamin also represents what's best about health care in America - - doctors and nurses who give and care and sacrifice for the sake of their patients ; those Americans who would do anything to heal a fellow citizen . <p/>As the President explained , through this personal experience working with the poor and uninsured , Dr . Benjamin understands firsthand the urgent need for health care reform . <p/>As Surgeon General , she will be the people's health advocate , and will play a key role in health care reform . <p/>In her remarks , Dr . Benjamin explained how she sees her role : <p/>My hope , if confirmed as Surgeon General , is to be America's doctor , America's family physician . <p/>As we work toward a solution to this health care crisis , I promise to communicate directly with the American people to help guide them through whatever changes may come with health care reform ."

Surgeon General in a Rose Garden announcement late this morning . <p/>Benjamin , an Alabama family physician , runs a rural health clinic in Bayou La Batre . <p/>She was the first African - American woman to head a state medical society and received a MacArthur Foundation \"genius grant\" last year . <p/>She became known nationally for her determination to rebuild her clinic , destroyed in Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . <p/>In her profile on the National Institutes of Health web site , Benjamin writes about her calling to become a doctor while in medical school at the University of Alabama at Birmingham . <p/>\"I believe it was divine intervention - it was in medical school when I realized there was nothing else I'd rather do with my life than to be a doctor . <p/>I had never seen a black doctor before I went to college , so I did not have an idea that I wanted to be one . <p/>I never thought I that I couldn't , but I never really thought about it at all . \" <p/>According to a 1997 article in Ebony , Benjamin said she applied to Yale University School of Law before she attended college . <p/>\"They sent me a reply politely telling me that I needed my undergraduate degree first . \" <p/>To pay for college , she turned to the National Health Service Corps , which gave her a tuition reimbursement in exchange for committing to work in areas where there was a shortage of doctors . <p/>That agreement took her to Bayou La Batre where she was the only doctor for 2 , 500 people , most of whom lived below the poverty line and spoke no English . <p/>Benjamin was named the Person of the Week on ABC News' World News Tonight in 1995 and conveyed the challenges of servicing poor patients . <p/>\"The people are real , genuine , hardworking . <p/>They're proud people . <p/>They make a living the best they can on shrimp boats . <p/>They , unfortunately , are too poor to pay their medical bills at times , \" she told ABC News' Peter Jennings . <p/>\"Sometimes it's very frustrating . <p/>Sometimes I can do everything that the textbooks taught me and school taught me and then patients can't buy their medicine . <p/>And it's all for nothing . \" <p/>In January , it was reported that President Obama had asked CNN's Dr . Sanjay Gupta to be Surgeon General , and that Gupta had mulled the offer for a while , but eventually turned it down . <p/>Benjamin will appear in the Rose Garden today as the president makes the nomination formal ."

Regina Benjamin <p/>I was immediately impressed with Dr . Regina Benjamin's background when President Obama nominated her for U . S . Surgeon General . <p/>She's led an impressive career , one that includes deciding to practice in a low - income community in the Gulf Coast of Alabama . <p/>The Bayou La Batre Rural Health Clinic has been a staple for residents since 1987 and often doesn't charge patients who can't afford to pay . <p/>The clinic also focuses heavily on preventative illness since this hits close to home for Dr . Benjamin . <p/>She lost her father to diabetics and high - blood pressure , her mother to lung cancer and her brother from a HIV - related illness . <p/>Personally and professionally , Dr . Benjamin has longed fought for the well - being of others . <p/>After researching her background , I had a gut feeling she was a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority , Inc . , a non - profit community service based organization . <p/>And it was confirmed several days later when the sorority's national president announced Dr . Benjamin became a member while completing her undergraduate degree at Xavier University in New Orleans , La . <p/>While I wasn't the only one impressed with Dr . Benjamin's background , there were also some who questioned her ability to perform the duties of Surgeon General . <p/>An article with the subtitle : \"Do you have to be thin to be fit for the role of nation's Top Doc ? \" , was published shortly after Dr . Benjamin's nomination . <p/>Dr . Arthur Caplan penned the article and defended Dr . Benjamin due to her tireless effort of serving those less fortunate . <p/>I applaud him for taking a stand on Dr . Benjamin's behalf . <p/>I don't condone a unhealthy lifestyle , but I'm sure Dr . Benjamin is probably like many of us . <p/>With hectic work schedules and families , it can be difficult to find time to lead a healthy lifestyle . <p/>I struggle with juggling my to - do - list daily and sometimes exercise and healthy eating doesn't make the cut . <p/>It's no secret that women are confronted with these issues more than men . <p/>I'm calling on women to speak up for Dr . Benjamin . <p/>You don't have to agree with the policies of President Obama or even with the nomination of Dr . Benjamin , but we can't continue to allow society to dictate our outer appearance . <p/>Women , start making your Moves today !"

C . , Jul 13 , 2009 / 02 : 00 pm ( CNA ) <p/>President Barack Obama has announced that he is nominating a rural Alabama Catholic doctor to be the U . S . Surgeon General . <p/>Reacting to the news , the rector of Mobile's Catholic cathedral , where she serves as lector , is encouraging her to defend the unborn in her new position . <p/>In a Monday statement President Obama <mark id=\"mark_id\"> said </mark> he intended to nominate Dr . Regina Benjamin as Surgeon General , the United States government's \"chief health educator . \" <p/>The president's announcement focused on health care reform as an urgent challenge . <p/>Dr . Benjamin , the first black woman to be admitted to the American Medical Association , founded the Bayou La Batre Rural Health Clinic in Alabama in 1990 . <p/>There , she served the poor Alabama community on the Gulf Coast after 1998's Hurricane Georges and 2005's Hurricane Katrina . <p/>She had to rebuild the clinic after it burned down , receiving a $500 , 000 MacArthur Foundation \"genius grant\" in 2008 for the effort . <p/>Dr . Benjamin is known as being a national leader in improving health disparities , motivated by the need in her community . <p/>Immigrants from Vietnam , Cambodia and Laos make up a third of the area's population of 2 , 500 . <p/>She received the Nelson Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights in 1998 . <p/>Pope Benedict XVI awarded her the Pro Ecclessia et Pontifice medal in 2006 . <p/>President Obama's announcement also noted that Dr . Benjamin received the 2000 National Caring Award which was inspired by Mother Teresa . <p/>The nominee graduated from Xavier University in New Orleans , a Catholic school descended from the educational work of St . Katharine Drexel . <p/>Dr . Benjamin received her medical degree from the University of Alabama , Birmingham . <p/>Dr . Benjamin has also served on the Board of Trustees for the Catholic Health Association , a position that she will resign from to take on her new job . <p/>In a Monday statement , CHA president and chief executive officer Sister Carol Keehan , DC , said that the organization \"rejoices for our nation\" in Dr . Benjamin's nomination . <p/>\"In Dr . Benjamin , we have a brilliant physician who understands health care , nationally and internationally ; but even more important , she knows the health care needs of the people of Bayou La Batre , Alabama , who she meets on a daily basis . \" <p/>Sr . Keehan said the nominee will \"enrich the nation\" with her competence and integrity and she praised Dr . Benjamin's daily experience working in \"a very vulnerable committee . \" <p/>CNA spoke with Msgr . Michael L . Farmer , Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Mobile and rector at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Mobile . <p/>Msgr . Farmer said Dr . Benjamin is a \"delightful lady\" who has served as lector at the cathedral and has been \"readily available\" to speak with various Catholic organizations . <p/>She has also worked with Catholic Charities in Mobile and has spoken on the good the organization does . <p/>He reported that she grew up at the historically African - American parish Shrine of the Holy Cross in the Gulf Coast town of Daphne , Alabama . <p/>The monsignor also confirmed that then - Archbishop of Mobile Oscar Lipscomb recommended Dr . Regina Benjamin for the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice award . <p/>The medal is bestowed to lay people and clergy who have given zealous and outstanding service to the Church . <p/>The honor was instituted by Pope Leo XIII in 1888 . <p/>\"He recommended her for her example in her Catholic faith as well as in her medical profession , \" Msgr . Farmer said , noting the \"amazing amount of work\" she has done for the common good and for health care in south Mobile County . <p/>Expressing certainty that Dr . Benjamin had opportunities to go elsewhere , he said the doctor had made a \"concrete decision\" to remain in Alabama and address her patients' needs . <p/>\"She's noted not only for clinic work , but for going on site to these people's homes . <p/>And they're not necessarily the nicest places to go to . \" <p/>He said it was \"remarkable\" and \"bridge - building\" that Dr . Benjamin , an African - American woman , has done her work in the bayou , which he described as a majority white community with \"a lot of poor people in it . \" <p/>Given the appointments and policy decisions of the Obama Administration that favor the promotion of abortion , CNA asked Msgr . Farmer if he knew what Dr . Benjamin's position is on abortion . <p/>He explained that he did not \"explicitly\" know Dr . Benjamin's position on abortion and other life issues and had never discussed it with her . <p/>\"I would hope that her position would be in line with the Church's position , \" he told CNA . <p/>\"As far as I know she has been in conformity with the Catholic Church . \" <p/>\"I would hope that that would continue , \" he added , noting that it could be \"difficult\" to adhere to Catholic moral teaching in a position with the Obama Administration . <p/>In a Monday morning telephone interview with CNA , Sr . Keehan pointed out that Dr . Benjamin isn't \"in a specialty that would do abortion\" and that her work to provide health care to the poor and elderly demonstrates her \"tremendous attention to the issue of life . \" <p/>\"And you've got her own archbishop who asked the Holy Father to give her the Pro Ecclesia medal . <p/>\"You don't get that for just being a token Catholic , \" she told CNA . <p/>In December 2008 a coalition of several dozen pro - abortion groups released a strategy document titled \"Advancing Reproductive Rights and Health in a New Administration\" calling on Obama to improve access to \"abortion care . \" <p/>The document named the surgeon general's office as a \"position of interest . \""

'' <p/>The arrest will not affect Jackson 's status for Sunday 's game . <p/>The NFL 's collective bargaining agreement gives the league , not teams , authority to punish players for alcohol and substance abuses . <p/>Any discipline by the league would be meted out for the 2009 season , several sources said . <p/>A suspension certainly is possible . <p/>The NFL 's substance-abuse policy states : `` Discipline for a second or subsequent offense is likely to be a suspension , the duration of which may escalate for repeat offenses . '' <p/>Jared Allen , then with Kansas City , was suspended for the first four games of the 2007 season after being charged with DUI twice in one year . <p/>The NFL later reduced his suspension to two games . <p/>Chargers players had the day off yesterday . <p/>General Manager A.J. Smith issued the following statement on Jackson 's arrest : <p/>`` We 're aware of the off-the-field issue involving Vincent . <p/>Obviously , we 're disappointed . <p/>We take these issues very seriously . <p/>Moving forward , we will monitor the situation and have no further comment . '' <p/>Jackson was driving a 2008 GMC Sierra registered to him , Baehr said . <p/>He was booked into county jail and was released by 6 a.m. , Baehr said . <p/>Jackson , in his fourth season , caught a career-high 59 passes and led the team with 1,098 yards , also a career high . <p/>His seven receiving touchdowns were also a career best and second on the team . <p/>Earlier this week , Smith called Jackson a `` true professional '' and `` ultimate team player '' for how hard Jackson played even while not catching any passes . <p/>`` You win championships with players like Vincent Jackson , '' Smith said . <p/>The general manager has put an emphasis on character and avoiding off-the-field issues . <p/>The Chargers have not had any arrests become public this season and have been relatively trouble-free in recent years . <p/>In 2006 , linebacker Steve Foley was shot by an off-duty Coronado policeman who suspected Foley of driving under the influence . <p/>Foley pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drunken driving and was placed on five years ' probation . <p/>In July , he settled a lawsuit against the city of Coronado for $ 5.5 million . <p/>Jackson 's contract runs through 2009 , and he is among the hottest young receivers in the league . <p/>What becomes of this incident , combined with the previous DUI , could affect Jackson 's long-term future with the Chargers . <p/>Smith has let go a number of players who have had off-the-field troubles . <p/>While none was as productive or possessed the upside of Jackson , Smith did last February release tackle Shane Olivea just two years after signing Olivea to a contract that guaranteed him $ 9 million . <p/>Olivea later underwent treatment for an addiction to pain killers . <p/>`` You 're a Charger one year at a time , '' Smith has often said . <p/>Recently , speaking of the lack of incidents involving his players , Smith said , `` It 's very important if you want to be a Charger you do the right things on and off the field . '' <p/>The Chargers leave Friday for Pittsburgh , where they will face the Steelers at 1:45 p.m. Sunday ."

He bleeds Philadelphia , \" team president Billy King said . <p/>Cheeks will be introduced as Philadelphia's 21st head coach at a Tuesday news conference . <p/>Philadelphia is certainly banking on the former point guard to have a happier homecoming than O'Brien , a Philadelphia native who played for Saint Joseph's . <p/>O'Brien's stubbornness and seemingly unwavering belief in a system that didn't fit his players cost him his job despite a 43 - 39 record and a return to the playoffs . <p/>\"I just felt the direction we were going and the overall play wasn't where we wanted to go , \" King said . <p/>O'Brien just finished the first year of a three - year deal that included an option and paid him about $4 million a year . <p/>O'Brien , though , was not very popular with his players - - most notably former All - Star Chris Webber - - who often complained about their roles . <p/>King said after the Sixers were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Detroit that he planned to bring O'Brien back . <p/>After meeting with his players and other members of management , King had a change of heart and decided over the weekend he had to make a change . <p/>Certainly , King knows a thing or two about making changes - - Cheeks will be the fifth Sixers coach in four years under his watch . <p/>Larry Brown left for Detroit following the 2002 - 03 season , and assistant Randy Ayers was promoted and fired 52 games into the 2003 - 04 season before he was replaced by Chris Ford . <p/>\"I knew this thing was coming , and it wasn't an easy thing for anybody , \" Brown said from Miami before coaching the Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals . <p/>\"Knowing Billy , it's not easy to let a coach go . <p/>His relationship with Randy was pretty strong . <p/>I think it was hard for him to let Chris go . <p/>He was excited about having Jimmy , but I don't think it ever gets easy . \" <p/>Cheeks was one of the most popular 76ers from 1978 - 89 and played on Philadelphia's last championship team in 1983 . <p/>He also spent seven seasons as an assistant coach for the 76ers , was part of the staff under Brown when they went to the NBA Finals in 2001 and developed a strong bond with Allen Iverson . <p/>Cheeks was fired March 2 after nearly four seasons as coach of the Trail Blazers . <p/>He had a 162 - 139 record in Portland , the fourth - highest win total in Blazers history . <p/>Cheeks guided the team to the playoffs his first two seasons , but the players hardly made Cheeks' tenure easy - - on or off the court . <p/>The team was nicknamed the \"Jail Blazers\" after several brushes with the law , many of them involving marijuana possession . <p/>\"If players have problems with Mo Cheeks . . . then there's got to be something wrong with those players , \" King said . <p/>But Cheeks' return to the city where he was a four - time All - Star shouldn't come as a surprise . <p/>The Trail Blazers turned down Philadelphia's request to speak to Cheeks as a possible replacement for Brown , but the former point guard always remained popular with Philly fans and was at the top of the Sixers' short list to take over for Ford . <p/>Now , they'll get their wish . <p/>\"We do not want to change coaches [ again ] , \" Sixers chairman Ed Snider said . <p/>\"We've seen enough coaches . \" <p/>The Sixers will pay Ayers , O'Brien and Cheeks next season . <p/>\"I don't think it's something we're very proud of , but I don't think it reflects poorly , \" Snider said . <p/>O'Brien is the son - in - law of Hall of Fame coach Jack Ramsay . <p/>He led the Sixers to a 10 - win improvement from a year ago and they returned to the playoffs , largely on the back of a healthy , happy Iverson . <p/>While O'Brien avoided public spats with Iverson , he did not have the full support of the rest of the team . <p/>Some of the younger players , like Samuel Dalembert and Willie Green , felt they did not develop like they should have under O'Brien and were unsure about their roles . <p/>\"In looking at the development of some of them , yeah , I wasn't pleased , \" King said . <p/>The Sixers also failed to really understand O'Brien's defense , a sticking point even in the postseason . <p/>\"Some of the criteria on our defense wasn't there , \" King said . <p/>Cheeks , who once famously came to the rescue of a 13 - year - old girl who forgot the words to the national anthem before a playoff game , now hopes to bail out his former team and bring them another championship . <p/>\"Mo has played this game here in Philadelphia , won a championship here in Philadelphia , understands players , understands defenses , understands the way I think we want to play , \" King said ."

  "marked_doc": "Not because Mo Cheeks was long for the job with the Philadelphia 76ers . <p/>Like all coaches not in the upper stratosphere of the coaching hierarchy -- your Phil Jacksons and Gregg Popoviches -- he was only as good as his last 10-game stretch , only as secure as how well his star was playing . <p/>But the 76ers , while underachieving at 9-14 when Cheeks was <mark id=\"mark_id\"> fired </mark> Saturday morning , were not an embarassment when they went on the court , not a disjointed bunch that clearly was no longer listening to or playing for its coach . <p/>This was n't P.J. Carlesimo ( Oklahoma City ) or Eddie Jordan ( Washington ) , whose team 's putrid won-loss records sank any chance they had of survival . <p/>This was n't Sam Mitchell ( Toronto ) , whose differences of opinion with his general manager about his team 's personnel were too big to overcome . <p/>This was n't Randy Wittman ( Minnesota ) , whose fan base was staying away in droves as the paying public grew indifferent to the on-court product . <p/>The timing of this move by team president and general manager Ed Stefanski was a head-scratcher . <p/>`` It 's not 100 percent on the coach , '' a source with knowledge of the 76ers ' thinking said Saturday afternoon . <p/>`` But at the same time , we did n't seem to have a plan . '' <p/>Stefanski named assistant general manager Tony DiLeo coach for the rest of the season . <p/>DiLeo has a good reputation as a coach , spending time over the last two decades on the Sixers ' bench as an assistant and in Europe as a head coach . <p/>But unless circumstances change dramatically , Jordan -- who became close with Stefanski while both were in New Jersey earlier this decade -- will be the odds-on favorite to get the job permanantly . <p/>Many league execs still think quite highly of Jordan , and none of the players who matter in Washington threw Jordan under the bus after he was fired . <p/>Cheeks ' coaching moves have frequently been criticized over the years , both in Philadelphia and in Portland . <p/>But he lost his job this time not only because of Xs and Os , but because so many of the 76ers ' players that blossomed under him last season , including center Sam Dalembert , forward Andre Iguodala and guard Lou Williams , struggled to get going this season . <p/>And the moves Cheeks made , like benching second-year forward Thaddeus Young and elevating guard Willie Green , have n't produced enough dividends . <p/>`` Ed just was n't seeing any progress , '' the source said , and Stefanski expected more from a team that had signed free agent Elton Brand to an $ 82 million deal and re-signed core players Iguodala and Williams for $ 80 million and $ 25 million , respectively . <p/>`` We were n't progressing at the rate [ Stefanski ] thought we should , and he thought it was time for a move , '' the source said . <p/>Yet Stefanski can not escape criticism , either . <p/>Bringing Brand in was the signing coup of the NBA offseason , to be sure . <p/>But in doing that , Stefanski changed the team 's footprint . <p/>The Sixers are still a very good transition team . <p/>But when the game slows down , having to cater to Brand leaves the lane clogged . <p/>Last season , Iguodala , Young and Williams had driving room when Philly ran its halfcourt sets , and Dalembert showed occasional decent low-post play . <p/>But now , Brand is the man in the paint , forcing everyone else out on the perimeter . <p/>Left to fend for himself on the weakside , Dalembert 's numbers have plummeted , and Williams has just begun to play well . <p/>Brand is recovered from the Achilles ' injury that kept him out of all but eight games last season with the Clippers , but he 's been slowed by a bad hamstring , and his offensive numbers ( 15.9 points , a career-low .436 from the floor ) have been unspectactular . <p/>No matter what the stats say , Philly looks and plays slower this season . <p/>And Stefanski did n't get a big-time shooter who could stretch the court and take pressure off of Brand inside . <p/>Veterans Donyell Marshall and Kareem Rush , signed later in the summer by Philly , do n't strike much fear into opposing teams . <p/>The result is Philly 's 93.3 scoring average , 28th in the league ( only Charlotte and Oklahoma City have scored 100 points fewer times than Philadelphia 's six ) , and .314 percentage behind the three-point line , 26th in the league . <p/>`` Everybody zones them , '' an Eastern Conference executive said Saturday . <p/>The Sixers had just scored one of their more impressive victories eight days ago , rallying from a double-digit deficit in the second half to win on the road at Detroit . <p/>True , they had bad losses early to the Bobcats and Timberwolves , and lost a home-and-home to the Cavaliers on Wednesday and Friday . <p/>But last we checked , Cleveland was 20-3 , owner of an 11-game win streak and the only remaining undefeated team at home this season . <p/>The Cavs are rolling , and losing to them is no embarassment . <p/>Another league source with knowledge of the team 's thinking said Saturday that the Cleveland losses played no role in Cheeks 's firing . <p/>Cheeks received his second one-year contract extension in less than a year last September , taking him through the 2009-10 season . <p/>While Stefanski did n't hire Cheeks ( that was former president Billy King , whom Stefanski replaced early last season ) , Stefanski and Cheeks had quickly established a solid , working relationship with one another . <p/>Cheeks quickly acquiesced last year when Stefanski asked him to give more time to the team 's younger players , getting Young and young vets Rodney Carney and Williams bigger minutes . <p/>The transition transformed the team , as the 76ers went on a 19-7 run last spring , turning opponents over and becoming deadly in transition . <p/>They rode their hot streak into the playoffs , where they stretched Detroit to six games before succumbing in the first round . <p/>They were n't a finished product , though , and it was no secret that Brand was Stefanski 's target , just as he 'd been King 's ultimate target . <p/>After a brief dalliance with Atlanta free agent Josh Smith , So Stefanski cleared as much cap room as possible , sending Carney and center Calvin Booth to Minnesota , and then struck , getting Brand to spurn his former team , the Clippers , as well as the Warriors , for the Sixers ' $ 80 million offer -- the `` Philly Max , '' as Brand later called it . <p/>After keeping Iguodala and Williams , all the heat was on Cheeks . <p/>Saturday , he became the latest coach -- one-sixth of the league 's head men already gone in little more than five weeks -- to succumb to the pyre ."
