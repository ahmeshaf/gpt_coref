Tim Fanning said the man , who had recently lost his job at Tallgrass , walked into the party and pointed the gun at the victim . <p/>He then let about a dozen employees leave before holing up inside the office building with the victim . <p/>Hostage negotiators were called in to get the man out of the building . <p/>He finally surrendered at 6 p.m. and was arrested . <p/>Fanning could n't say if anyone else was in the building at the time , but said no one else was injured . <p/>Police used a neighbouring office as a base for the negotiations . <p/>Nigel Hacker , who runs Intarsia Design out of a heritage home at 2016 Ontario , said he was in his office waiting for people to attend a meeting at about 4 : 20 p.m . <p/>He looked outside to see the street cordoned off . <p/>Police set up shop at the office and began trying to coax the gunman out of the building around the corner at 40 East 5th Avenue . <p/>`` There was someone in the building and they were trying to get him out , '' Hacker said . <p/>`` I tried not to listen .

'' <p/>Just before 7 p.m. Friday , the lights were still blazing at the two-storey 1950s-style office building , which was decorated with a Christmas tree and Santas made of cotton wool . <p/>Early on , about a dozen police officers milled about outside securing the building , while others blocked nearby intersections and directed traffic away from Ontario Street . <p/>A Coast Mountain bus was called in to collect witnesses , TransLink spokesman Drew Snider said . <p/>Offices around the neighbourhood were shut down , with staff either told to stay indoors or escorted outside to their cars or other transport . <p/>Lorin Pearce , an executive assistant at Focus Audio Visual Services on West Fifth , said she saw what appeared to be a police officer with a gun at the corner of Fifth and Ontario . <p/>She did n't know the focus of the police attention , but said the corner is home to several businesses . <p/>When some employees tried to leave , they were told by police to stay inside the office until further notice , she said around 5 : 30 p.m . <p/>`` A couple of us tried to exit and they said , 'Please go back inside , ' '' <p/>Pearce said , adding she was not afraid for her own safety . <p/>Staff at Fiji Island Auto , across the street from Tallgrass , were told to close shop at 5:30 p.m. and were escorted by police off the premises . <p/>Down the street , John Christie , head of house production for Paperny Films at Fifth and Quebec , said employees were planning to hold an office party upstairs when someone heard shots fired and the police came knocking at their door . <p/>`` We have been asked by the police to stay away from the windows and we 've been forced to go downstairs , '' Christie said . <p/>`` We 're having an office party anyway so we 're just staying out of the way , undercover . <p/>If we 're in a lockdown , at least we have beers and pizza . '' <p/>Christie said the police , who placed an undercover officer at Paperny 's front door , were n't pleased when some office workers fled through the back alley to get home . <p/>An employee of another nearby business , Relaxus Massage Products , said staff were escorted to their cars by police so they could go home . <p/>TallGrass claims it is the fastest-growing natural-health-product supplier to the Natural Health Industry in Canada . <p/>It was originally called Tallgrass Hemp Company , and supplied a variety of products based on the hemp plant , including Body Dope , a line of hair- and skin-care products made with hemp and other botanicals . <p/>Products also include shampoo , conditioner , therapeutic lotion and soap",

Benjamin's accomplishments , and we are extremely fortunate that she has just served a term as chair of the AMA's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs . <p/>She served as a member of the AMA's Board of Trustees with the dual distinctions of being the AMA's first young physician trustee , as well as the first African - American woman board member . <p/>We look forward to seeing Dr . Benjamin serve as an advocate for all the nation's patients , as our country works toward health reform that provides high quality , affordable health coverage for all . \"",

'' <p/>The arrest will not affect Jackson 's <mark id=\"mark_id\"> status </mark> for Sunday 's game . <p/>The NFL 's collective bargaining agreement gives the league , not teams , authority to punish players for alcohol and substance abuses . <p/>Any discipline by the league would be meted out for the 2009 season , several sources said . <p/>A suspension certainly is possible . <p/>The NFL 's substance-abuse policy states : `` Discipline for a second or subsequent offense is likely to be a suspension , the duration of which may escalate for repeat offenses . '' <p/>Jared Allen , then with Kansas City , was suspended for the first four games of the 2007 season after being charged with DUI twice in one year . <p/>The NFL later reduced his suspension to two games . <p/>Chargers players had the day off yesterday . <p/>General Manager A.J. Smith issued the following statement on Jackson 's arrest : <p/>`` We 're aware of the off-the-field issue involving Vincent . <p/>Obviously , we 're disappointed . <p/>We take these issues very seriously . <p/>Moving forward , we will monitor the situation and have no further comment . '' <p/>Jackson was driving a 2008 GMC Sierra registered to him , Baehr said . <p/>He was booked into county jail and was released by 6 a.m. , Baehr said . <p/>Jackson , in his fourth season , caught a career-high 59 passes and led the team with 1,098 yards , also a career high . <p/>His seven receiving touchdowns were also a career best and second on the team . <p/>Earlier this week , Smith called Jackson a `` true professional '' and `` ultimate team player '' for how hard Jackson played even while not catching any passes . <p/>`` You win championships with players like Vincent Jackson , '' Smith said . <p/>The general manager has put an emphasis on character and avoiding off-the-field issues . <p/>The Chargers have not had any arrests become public this season and have been relatively trouble-free in recent years . <p/>In 2006 , linebacker Steve Foley was shot by an off-duty Coronado policeman who suspected Foley of driving under the influence . <p/>Foley pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drunken driving and was placed on five years ' probation . <p/>In July , he settled a lawsuit against the city of Coronado for $ 5.5 million . <p/>Jackson 's contract runs through 2009 , and he is among the hottest young receivers in the league . <p/>What becomes of this incident , combined with the previous DUI , could affect Jackson 's long-term future with the Chargers . <p/>Smith has let go a number of players who have had off-the-field troubles . <p/>While none was as productive or possessed the upside of Jackson , Smith did last February release tackle Shane Olivea just two years after signing Olivea to a contract that guaranteed him $ 9 million . <p/>Olivea later underwent treatment for an addiction to pain killers . <p/>`` You 're a Charger one year at a time , '' Smith has often said . <p/>Recently , speaking of the lack of incidents involving his players , Smith said , `` It 's very important if you want to be a Charger you do the right things on and off the field .

M . FEB . 4 , 2009 <p/>Two years ago , the Chargers won an NFL special award for helping start a San Diego program by which players who've been imbibing can call a private number for a ride home , an alternative to driving under the influence . <p/>A former Chargers fullback , Lorenzo Neal , was among the co - founders of the \u201c Safe Ride Solutions \u201d program that since has been expanded to other NFL cities . <p/>Evidently , though , the drinking and driving problem hasn't been eradicated in San Diego . <p/>Sunday , for the second time in less than four weeks , a Chargers player was pulled over in the early - morning hours and arrested on suspicion of DUI . <p/>\u201c It's disappointing to hear about the issue involving Jamal Williams , \u201d said General Manager A . J . Smith in a news release issued by the team yesterday . <p/>\u201c We'll continue to monitor the situation and let the legal process run its course . \u201d <p/>Smith's statement served as the only comment from the Chargers . <p/>A request to interview club President Dean Spanos was declined by a spokesman . <p/>As it is , the Chargers are still awaiting the disposition of a similar case involving wide receiver Vincent Jackson , arrested Jan . 6 in Clairemont on suspicion of driving under the influence . <p/>Jackson , also facing charges of driving while on probation for a prior DUI , has an arraignment set for Feb . 17 in San Diego Superior Court . <p/>Williams , a three - time Pro Bowl nose tackle , was stopped for speeding westbound on state route 94 at approximately 1 : 30 a . m Sunday . <p/>Arrested by the CHP on suspicion of drunken driving , he was booked into county jail and later released on bond . <p/>Results of Williams' blood - alcohol test have not been released . <p/>\u201c These are just two more arrests that we've had , \u201d said Pat Hodgkin , local executive director of Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) , noting that roughly 13 , 000 DUI convictions are issued every year in San Diego County . <p/>\u201c However , these are media - worthy professionals . <p/>These are individuals that not only youth looks up to , but adults look up to as well . <p/>They need to understand that they have an effect on people and a responsibility . \u201d <p/>The Chargers were involved in one of the most publicized and bizarre instances of a DUI stop in 2006 . <p/>Linebacker Steve Foley was shot three times by an off - duty Coronado police officer who followed Foley from downtown to the player's home in Poway . <p/>Foley , his career ended by the bullet wounds , later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor DUI . <p/>It was that case that prompted Gary Lawrence , a detective with the Northern Division of the San Diego Police Department , to ally with the Chargers in a program in which players who've been drinking would call \u201c Safe Ride Solutions \u201d and be driven home by an off - duty member of law enforcement . <p/>\u201c Anytime anybody's arrested for DUI , I get very disappointed , and not just when athletes are involved , \u201d said Lawrence yesterday . <p/>\u201c We're talking about a crime where people are killed or injured , a crime where people go to jail , and it's 100 percent preventable . \u201d <p/>Citing his company's confidentiality agreement with clients , Lawrence declined to discuss anything specific pertaining to the Chargers and their players . <p/>From its start with the team , though , the business has grown to include clients from other high - profile realms and put to work by other NFL franchises . <p/>In recognition of the program , the league gave the Chargers its Winston - Shell Award in 2007 for \u201c demonstrating commitment and dedication to developing unique and innovative ideas and solutions . \u201d",

He bleeds Philadelphia , \" team president Billy King said . <p/>Cheeks will be introduced as Philadelphia's 21st head coach at a Tuesday news conference . <p/>Philadelphia is certainly banking on the former point guard to have a happier homecoming than O'Brien , a Philadelphia native who played for Saint Joseph's . <p/>O'Brien's stubbornness and seemingly unwavering belief in a system that didn't fit his players cost him his job despite a 43 - 39 record and a return to the playoffs . <p/>\"I just felt the direction we were going and the overall play wasn't where we wanted to go , \" King said . <p/>O'Brien just finished the first year of a three - year deal that included an option and paid him about $4 million a year . <p/>O'Brien , though , was not very popular with his players - - most notably former All - Star Chris Webber - - who often complained about their roles . <p/>King said after the Sixers were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Detroit that he planned to bring O'Brien back . <p/>After meeting with his players and other members of management , King had a change of heart and decided over the weekend he had to make a change . <p/>Certainly , King knows a thing or two about making changes - - Cheeks will be the fifth Sixers coach in four years under his watch . <p/>Larry Brown left for Detroit following the 2002 - 03 season , and assistant Randy Ayers was promoted and fired 52 games into the 2003 - 04 season before he was replaced by Chris Ford . <p/>\"I knew this thing was coming , and it wasn't an easy thing for anybody , \" Brown said from Miami before coaching the Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals . <p/>\"Knowing Billy , it's not easy to let a coach go . <p/>His relationship with Randy was pretty strong . <p/>I think it was hard for him to let Chris go . <p/>He was excited about having Jimmy , but I don't think it ever gets easy . \" <p/>Cheeks was one of the most popular 76ers from 1978 - 89 and played on Philadelphia's last championship team in 1983 . <p/>He also spent seven seasons as an assistant coach for the 76ers , was part of the staff under Brown when they went to the NBA Finals in 2001 and developed a strong bond with Allen Iverson . <p/>Cheeks was fired March 2 after nearly four seasons as coach of the Trail Blazers . <p/>He had a 162 - 139 record in Portland , the fourth - highest win total in Blazers history . <p/>Cheeks guided the team to the playoffs his first two seasons , but the players hardly made Cheeks' tenure easy - - on or off the court . <p/>The team was nicknamed the \"Jail Blazers\" after several brushes with the law , many of them involving marijuana possession . <p/>\"If players have problems with Mo Cheeks . . . then there's got to be something wrong with those players , \" King said . <p/>But Cheeks' return to the city where he was a four - time All - Star shouldn't come as a surprise . <p/>The Trail Blazers turned down Philadelphia's request to speak to Cheeks as a possible replacement for Brown , but the former point guard always remained popular with Philly fans and was at the top of the Sixers' short list to take over for Ford . <p/>Now , they'll get their wish . <p/>\"We do not want to change coaches [ again ] , \" Sixers chairman Ed Snider said . <p/>\"We've seen enough coaches . \" <p/>The Sixers will pay Ayers , O'Brien and Cheeks next season . <p/>\"I don't think it's something we're very proud of , but I don't think it reflects poorly , \" Snider said . <p/>O'Brien is the son - in - law of Hall of Fame coach Jack Ramsay . <p/>He led the Sixers to a 10 - win improvement from a year ago and they returned to the playoffs , largely on the back of a healthy , happy Iverson . <p/>While O'Brien avoided public spats with Iverson , he did not have the full support of the rest of the team . <p/>Some of the younger players , like Samuel Dalembert and Willie Green , felt they did not develop like they should have under O'Brien and were unsure about their roles . <p/>\"In looking at the development of some of them , yeah , I wasn't pleased , \" King said . <p/>The Sixers also failed to really understand O'Brien's defense , a sticking point even in the postseason . <p/>\"Some of the criteria on our defense wasn't there , \" King said . <p/>Cheeks , who once famously came to the rescue of a 13 - year - old girl who forgot the words to the national anthem before a playoff game , now hopes to bail out his former team and bring them another championship . <p/>\"Mo has played this game here in Philadelphia , won a championship here in Philadelphia , understands players , understands defenses , understands the way I think we want to play , \" King said .",

  "marked_doc": "Not because Mo Cheeks was long for the job with the Philadelphia 76ers . <p/>Like all coaches not in the upper stratosphere of the coaching hierarchy -- your Phil Jacksons and Gregg Popoviches -- he was only as good as his last 10-game stretch , only as secure as how well his star was playing . <p/>But the 76ers , while underachieving at 9-14 when Cheeks was fired Saturday morning , were not an embarassment when they <mark id=\"mark_id\"> went </mark> on the court , not a disjointed bunch that clearly was no longer listening to or playing for its coach . <p/>This was n't P.J. Carlesimo ( Oklahoma City ) or Eddie Jordan ( Washington ) , whose team 's putrid won-loss records sank any chance they had of survival . <p/>This was n't Sam Mitchell ( Toronto ) , whose differences of opinion with his general manager about his team 's personnel were too big to overcome . <p/>This was n't Randy Wittman ( Minnesota ) , whose fan base was staying away in droves as the paying public grew indifferent to the on-court product . <p/>The timing of this move by team president and general manager Ed Stefanski was a head-scratcher . <p/>`` It 's not 100 percent on the coach , '' a source with knowledge of the 76ers ' thinking said Saturday afternoon . <p/>`` But at the same time , we did n't seem to have a plan . '' <p/>Stefanski named assistant general manager Tony DiLeo coach for the rest of the season . <p/>DiLeo has a good reputation as a coach , spending time over the last two decades on the Sixers ' bench as an assistant and in Europe as a head coach . <p/>But unless circumstances change dramatically , Jordan -- who became close with Stefanski while both were in New Jersey earlier this decade -- will be the odds-on favorite to get the job permanantly . <p/>Many league execs still think quite highly of Jordan , and none of the players who matter in Washington threw Jordan under the bus after he was fired . <p/>Cheeks ' coaching moves have frequently been criticized over the years , both in Philadelphia and in Portland . <p/>But he lost his job this time not only because of Xs and Os , but because so many of the 76ers ' players that blossomed under him last season , including center Sam Dalembert , forward Andre Iguodala and guard Lou Williams , struggled to get going this season . <p/>And the moves Cheeks made , like benching second-year forward Thaddeus Young and elevating guard Willie Green , have n't produced enough dividends . <p/>`` Ed just was n't seeing any progress , '' the source said , and Stefanski expected more from a team that had signed free agent Elton Brand to an $ 82 million deal and re-signed core players Iguodala and Williams for $ 80 million and $ 25 million , respectively . <p/>`` We were n't progressing at the rate [ Stefanski ] thought we should , and he thought it was time for a move , '' the source said . <p/>Yet Stefanski can not escape criticism , either . <p/>Bringing Brand in was the signing coup of the NBA offseason , to be sure . <p/>But in doing that , Stefanski changed the team 's footprint . <p/>The Sixers are still a very good transition team . <p/>But when the game slows down , having to cater to Brand leaves the lane clogged . <p/>Last season , Iguodala , Young and Williams had driving room when Philly ran its halfcourt sets , and Dalembert showed occasional decent low-post play . <p/>But now , Brand is the man in the paint , forcing everyone else out on the perimeter . <p/>Left to fend for himself on the weakside , Dalembert 's numbers have plummeted , and Williams has just begun to play well . <p/>Brand is recovered from the Achilles ' injury that kept him out of all but eight games last season with the Clippers , but he 's been slowed by a bad hamstring , and his offensive numbers ( 15.9 points , a career-low .436 from the floor ) have been unspectactular . <p/>No matter what the stats say , Philly looks and plays slower this season . <p/>And Stefanski did n't get a big-time shooter who could stretch the court and take pressure off of Brand inside . <p/>Veterans Donyell Marshall and Kareem Rush , signed later in the summer by Philly , do n't strike much fear into opposing teams . <p/>The result is Philly 's 93.3 scoring average , 28th in the league ( only Charlotte and Oklahoma City have scored 100 points fewer times than Philadelphia 's six ) , and .314 percentage behind the three-point line , 26th in the league . <p/>`` Everybody zones them , '' an Eastern Conference executive said Saturday . <p/>The Sixers had just scored one of their more impressive victories eight days ago , rallying from a double-digit deficit in the second half to win on the road at Detroit . <p/>True , they had bad losses early to the Bobcats and Timberwolves , and lost a home-and-home to the Cavaliers on Wednesday and Friday . <p/>But last we checked , Cleveland was 20-3 , owner of an 11-game win streak and the only remaining undefeated team at home this season . <p/>The Cavs are rolling , and losing to them is no embarassment . <p/>Another league source with knowledge of the team 's thinking said Saturday that the Cleveland losses played no role in Cheeks 's firing . <p/>Cheeks received his second one-year contract extension in less than a year last September , taking him through the 2009-10 season . <p/>While Stefanski did n't hire Cheeks ( that was former president Billy King , whom Stefanski replaced early last season ) , Stefanski and Cheeks had quickly established a solid , working relationship with one another . <p/>Cheeks quickly acquiesced last year when Stefanski asked him to give more time to the team 's younger players , getting Young and young vets Rodney Carney and Williams bigger minutes . <p/>The transition transformed the team , as the 76ers went on a 19-7 run last spring , turning opponents over and becoming deadly in transition . <p/>They rode their hot streak into the playoffs , where they stretched Detroit to six games before succumbing in the first round . <p/>They were n't a finished product , though , and it was no secret that Brand was Stefanski 's target , just as he 'd been King 's ultimate target . <p/>After a brief dalliance with Atlanta free agent Josh Smith , So Stefanski cleared as much cap room as possible , sending Carney and center Calvin Booth to Minnesota , and then struck , getting Brand to spurn his former team , the Clippers , as well as the Warriors , for the Sixers ' $ 80 million offer -- the `` Philly Max , '' as Brand later called it . <p/>After keeping Iguodala and Williams , all the heat was on Cheeks . <p/>Saturday , he became the latest coach -- one-sixth of the league 's head men already gone in little more than five weeks -- to succumb to the pyre .",
