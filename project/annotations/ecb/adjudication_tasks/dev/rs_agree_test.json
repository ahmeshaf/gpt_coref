Tim Fanning . <p/>The other partygoers managed to escape unharmed . <p/>`` The shock was tremendous but all the other people in the business - and there another dozen other people who were there for a Christmas party - managed to get out safely , '' Fanning said . <p/>Police locked down the neighbourhood before the suspect turned himself in around 6 p.m . <p/>Police said Kirkpatrick was let go on Dec. 11 . <p/>A resident who lives in a nearby apartment building told The Canadian Press that he did not hear gunshots , but saw a woman run from the party and into a nearby auto repair shop , where it appears she called for help . <p/>`` All of a sudden in my front yard there were five totally decked out , geared up riot squad officers with guns out of the holster , aiming at the second floor of the building right beside us , '' Luke Pigeon said . <p/>`` I tried to open up my door and they said close your door , lock your door . '' <p/>Mark Pinder told The Canadian Press that police ordered a group of film studio employees into the basement of their building , which was across the street from the party . <p/>The group was just about to celebrate the completion of a project when police came knocking , he said . <p/>`` People grabbed a couple of bowls of chips and dip and we just sort of moved the party downstairs , '' Pinder said . <p/>`` Some people seemed quite concerned but there was n't anyone freaking out or crying . <p/>Everyone was calling their family and making sure that people knew they were OK . '' <p/>Pigeon said police spent about two hours negotiating with the suspect before bringing him into custody . <p/>`` They cuffed him on the ground and they took him into a cruiser , '' he said . <p/>`` He was giving them a bit of grief , he was saying that his cuffs hurt , but he was following orders . '' <p/>Employees who had been at the party at the time of the shooting are receiving counselling from the Vancouver police victim 's services team . <p/>`` I can not emphasize enough how traumatic this would have been for the people in there to see one of their co-workers gunned down , so we 're going to do all we can to help these people though a very , very difficult time , '' Fanning said ."

'' <p/>She said Ben and his wife grew up as neighbours on Hornby Island . <p/>`` That was how Ben and Linda knew each other .

'' <p/>`` He is placed in a double bunk with somebody who is withdrawing from drugs . <p/>He can not sleep . <p/>It 's freezing cold . <p/>The problem is that these institutions are too full . '' <p/>`` He 's presumed innocent and he should be treated better . '' <p/>Lon Wood , another retired Victoria journalist who knew Ben 's father from their days working in Victoria , said he met Ben and the other children through their parents . <p/>`` They are a very close family . '' <p/>John Paul Fraser of National Public Relations , which is working for TallGrass , said the family is not speaking publicly yet . <p/>At a weekend news conference , city police spokesman Const . <p/>Tim Fanning said Kirkpatrick had been let go from TallGrass on Thursday . <p/>Fanning did n't know how long the suspect had worked at the business . <p/>The other people at the office party were able to escape without injury , Fanning said . <p/>`` The shock was tremendous but all the other people in the business - and a dozen other people who were there for a Christmas party - managed to get out safely , '' Fanning said . <p/>The shocked party-goers were put on buses and taken to police headquarters where witness statements were taken , he said . <p/>He said counsellors have been made available to them ."

'' <p/>The February 2008 three-hour plus broadcast , hosted for the second time by Stewart , hit a low 32 million U.S. viewers and entered the record books as the least-watched Oscars ever . <p/>Still , even an audience of that size makes the telecast annually one of the most-watched U.S. TV shows . <p/>The broadcast also is televised live in more than 200 countries worldwide . <p/>Mark said he and Condon planned to get the telecast under three hours , yet still keep the live presentations of awards and acceptance speeches ."

'' <p/>A `` John McCain is so old '' joke is never in bad taste ! <p/>Stewart also oozed confidence , despite lackluster reviews of his hosting job in 2006 . <p/>DO Channel Johnny Carson . <p/>Carson is considered the epitome of the Oscar host . <p/>He hosted the ceremony five times and found that magical place where a joke is just biting enough , but does n't sting . <p/>`` I see some new faces here , especially on the old ones , '' he joked in one opening speech . <p/>See ? <p/>Slightly scathing , but playful . <p/>After all , the last thing you want to do is piss off your entire industry . <p/>DO Allow yourself to get star-struck . <p/>Even the Hollywood heavy-weights that host the Oscars are allowed to be overwhelmed by the folks the statuettes are being presented to . <p/>While obviously a part of her act , there was something very endearing about Ellen DeGeneres pausing in her host spiel to snap a Myspace picture of her and Clint Eastwood and letting the audience know what a thrill the experience of hosting for them was . <p/>Nothing 's going to get the audience on your side like admitting they they impress you . <p/>DO Go Big . <p/>Hollywood has never been about self-restraint or simplicity . <p/>When celebrating the movie industry you 've got to be lavish . <p/>While Jackman has a certain composed air about him and oozes class ( have you seen a picture of him in a tux ? ) he could benefit from a spectacular entrance like Whoopi Goldberg 's in 1999 ( she waltzed on stage in full Queen Elizabeth get-up ) . <p/>It 's Hollywood : go big , baby . <p/>DO Watch the time <p/>Since the introduction of the play-off music that cuts award recipients off when they get too long-winded ( is there anything more embarrassing than watching an A-lister chase the microphone as its lowered into the stage in order to get that last thank-you in ? ) , the Oscars have been trimmer in recent years . <p/>But just as dangerous as the ceremony going over is it running short . <p/>It happened in 1959 . <p/>Then host Jerry Lewis forced that year 's winners to dance awkwardly around the stage in order to fill the last twenty minutes of his broadcast . <p/>Mortifying . <p/>Avoid at all costs . <p/>DO N'T Appropriate . <p/>It will always be funny when Billy Crystal relives the year 's greatest films ( or rather , dodges certain death within them ) in an intricate opening montage . <p/>He 's done it eight times already and it has yet to get old . <p/>That being said , it 's Crystal 's thing . <p/>Jackman will have to come up with his own trademark hosting quirk . <p/>Might I suggest flashy , high-kicking song and dance numbers ? <p/>DO N'T Do anything that David Letterman did . <p/>Enough said . <p/>DO N'T Be afraid to be abusive or controversial . <p/>While no one ever wants to see a repeat of Michael Moore 's rant in 2001 , it 's the snippy , daring jokes and comments that are remembered , like Steve Martin 's improvistation right after the aforementioned tirade ."

'' <p/>He said the ship the Tabar fired on was laden with ammunition . <p/>All sorts of vessels -- freight and cargo ships , cruise liners and private yachts -- have been attacked in the waters off Somalia . <p/>In many hijackings , pirates take the crew and passengers hostage and demand a ransom . <p/>Just this month , Somali pirates captured two Yemeni fishing boats and 22 Yemeni fishermen in the Gulf of Aden , Yemen 's official news agency SABA reported . <p/>A day earlier , the German cruise liner MS Columbus said it would fly its 246 passengers and most of its crew over the Gulf of Aden instead of through it to avoid any pirate attack . <p/>The United States is reportedly circulating a proposal in the U.N. Security Council that would allow military forces to enter Somali territory in `` hot pursuit '' of pirates . <p/>The Pentagon said Friday , however , that there are no plans for U.S. forces to go ashore in pursuit of pirates in Somalia ."

Carlesimo ( Oklahoma City ) or Eddie Jordan ( Washington ) , whose team 's putrid won-loss records sank any chance they had of survival . <p/>This was n't Sam Mitchell ( Toronto ) , whose differences of opinion with his general manager about his team 's personnel were too big to overcome . <p/>This was n't Randy Wittman ( Minnesota ) , whose fan base was staying away in droves as the paying public grew indifferent to the on-court product . <p/>The timing of this move by team president and general manager Ed Stefanski was a head-scratcher . <p/>`` It 's not 100 percent on the coach , '' a source with knowledge of the 76ers ' thinking said Saturday afternoon . <p/>`` But at the same time , we did n't seem to have a plan .

will be the odds-on favorite to get the job permanantly . <p/>Many league execs still think quite highly of Jordan , and none of the players who matter in Washington threw Jordan under the bus after he was fired . <p/>Cheeks ' coaching moves have frequently been criticized over the years , both in Philadelphia and in Portland . <p/>But he lost his job this time not only because of Xs and Os , but because so many of the 76ers ' players that blossomed under him last season , including center Sam Dalembert , forward Andre Iguodala and guard Lou Williams , struggled to get going this season . <p/>And the moves Cheeks made , like benching second-year forward Thaddeus Young and elevating guard Willie Green , have n't produced enough dividends . <p/>`` Ed just was n't seeing any progress , '' the source said , and Stefanski expected more from a team that had signed free agent Elton Brand to an $ 82 million deal and re-signed core players Iguodala and Williams for $ 80 million and $ 25 million , respectively . <p/>`` We were n't progressing at the rate [ Stefanski ] thought we should , and he thought it was time for a move , '' the source said . <p/>Yet Stefanski can not escape criticism , either . <p/>Bringing Brand in was the signing coup of the NBA offseason , to be sure . <p/>But in doing that , Stefanski changed the team 's footprint . <p/>The Sixers are still a very good transition team . <p/>But when the game slows down , having to cater to Brand leaves the lane clogged . <p/>Last season , Iguodala , Young and Williams had driving room when Philly ran its halfcourt sets , and Dalembert showed occasional decent low-post play . <p/>But now , Brand is the man in the paint , forcing everyone else out on the perimeter . <p/>Left to fend for himself on the weakside , Dalembert 's numbers have plummeted , and Williams has just begun to play well . <p/>Brand is recovered from the Achilles ' injury that kept him out of all but eight games last season with the Clippers , but he 's been slowed by a bad hamstring , and his offensive numbers ( 15.9 points , a career-low .436 from the floor ) have been unspectactular . <p/>No matter what the stats say , Philly looks and plays slower this season . <p/>And Stefanski did n't get a big-time shooter who could stretch the court and take pressure off of Brand inside . <p/>Veterans Donyell Marshall and Kareem Rush , signed later in the summer by Philly , do n't strike much fear into opposing teams . <p/>The result is Philly 's 93.3 scoring average , 28th in the league ( only Charlotte and Oklahoma City have scored 100 points fewer times than Philadelphia 's six ) , and .314 percentage behind the three-point line , 26th in the league . <p/>`` Everybody zones them , '' an Eastern Conference executive said Saturday . <p/>The Sixers had just scored one of their more impressive victories eight days ago , rallying from a double-digit deficit in the second half to win on the road at Detroit . <p/>True , they had bad losses early to the Bobcats and Timberwolves , and lost a home-and-home to the Cavaliers on Wednesday and Friday . <p/>But last we checked , Cleveland was 20-3 , owner of an 11-game win streak and the only remaining undefeated team at home this season . <p/>The Cavs are rolling , and losing to them is no embarassment . <p/>Another league source with knowledge of the team 's thinking said Saturday that the Cleveland losses played no role in Cheeks 's firing . <p/>Cheeks received his second one-year contract extension in less than a year last September , taking him through the 2009-10 season . <p/>While Stefanski did n't hire Cheeks ( that was former president Billy King , whom Stefanski replaced early last season ) , Stefanski and Cheeks had quickly established a solid , working relationship with one another . <p/>Cheeks quickly acquiesced last year when Stefanski asked him to give more time to the team 's younger players , getting Young and young vets Rodney Carney and Williams bigger minutes . <p/>The transition transformed the team , as the 76ers went on a 19-7 run last spring , turning opponents over and becoming deadly in transition . <p/>They rode their hot streak into the playoffs , where they stretched Detroit to six games before succumbing in the first round . <p/>They were n't a finished product , though , and it was no secret that Brand was Stefanski 's target , just as he 'd been King 's ultimate target . <p/>After a brief dalliance with Atlanta free agent Josh Smith , So Stefanski cleared as much cap room as possible , sending Carney and center Calvin Booth to Minnesota , and then struck , getting Brand to spurn his former team , the Clippers , as well as the Warriors , for the Sixers ' $ 80 million offer -- the `` Philly Max , '' as Brand later called it . <p/>After keeping Iguodala and Williams , all the heat was on Cheeks . <p/>Saturday , he became the latest coach -- one-sixth of the league 's head men already gone in little more than five weeks -- to succumb to the pyre ."

'' <p/>`` It 's really important that we come up with a solution , '' he said . <p/>`` These are unheard-of times , and no one can predict what is going to happen '' with the U.S. economy . <p/>SAG 'S DARK CLOUD <p/>The Oscars , given out by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , are annually Hollywood 's glitziest night . <p/>Putting the show in jeopardy , however , was this week 's announcement by SAG that strike authorization ballots will be mailed to its 120,000 members on January 2 and tallied on January 23 , a full month before the Oscars . <p/>That sequence of events raises the prospect of A-list stars boycotting the honors to avoid crossing their own union 's picket lines -- or even carrying picket signs themselves . <p/>The same dynamic came into play last January when a work stoppage by 10,500 Writers Guild of America members threw the awards season into disarray and caused the star-filled Golden Globe Awards to be replaced by a news conference . <p/>Only 5.8 million TV viewers tuned-in , far below the Globes ' typical 20 million audience . <p/>Broadcaster NBC lost an estimated $ 10 million to $ 15 million in advertising revenue . <p/>The writers strike was settled a month later , sparing the Academy Awards and its network , ABC , a similar fate . <p/>But this time around , the Oscars are on the firing line and Australian actor Jackman , star of the `` X-Men '' movies as well as Broadway stage shows , may himself have to pull out . <p/>`` At this point , we are moving forward with all of our plans to do our show , and of course we are monitoring what is going on , '' said Academy spokeswoman Leslie Unger . <p/>SAG leaders say they need a credible strike threat to wrest a better contract deal from the studios than the `` final '' offer management presented before talks collapsed on June 30 . <p/>They stress , however , that a `` yes '' vote does not automatically put a strike into effect , and it remains uncertain whether SAG can muster the support it needs -- 75 percent of those voting -- to pass its authorization . <p/>Talks collapsed over issues that included how much actors would get paid for work on the Internet , and the financial impact of a possible strike on Hollywood remains unclear . <p/>Most films slated for release in 2009 already have been shot , meaning the 2010 slate would see the brunt of a strike . <p/>Some TV prime-time dramas and sitcoms will have completed production before SAG a work stoppage , though a walkout could hinder development of new series for Fall 2009 ."

Benjamin , MD , a family physician from southern Alabama , to be surgeon general . <p/>Dr . Benjamin , 52 , became the first woman and first African - American president of the Medical Assn . of the State of Alabama in 2002 . <p/>She also completed a term in June as chair of the AMA Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs and served on the AMA Board of Trustees from 1995 to 1998 , becoming the first physician under 40 to serve on the board in a non - resident role . <p/>On July 8 , Obama nominated Francis S . Collins , MD , PhD , as director of the National Institutes of Health . <p/>Dr . Collins , 59 , led the Human Genome Project - - an effort to sequence and map human genes , that concluded in 2003 . <p/>He left his position as director of the NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute in 2008 after 15 years but maintains a lab at the NIH's Bethesda , Md . , campus . <p/>Both nominees must first be confirmed by the Senate . <p/>AMA President J . James Rohack , MD , said Dr . Benjamin has an impressive list of accomplishments , including receiving a MacArthur Fellowship in 2008 , commonly known as the \"genius grant . \" <p/>But awards are not her main focus , he said . <p/>\"Dr . Benjamin's most important qualification for surgeon general is her deep commitment to her patients . \" <p/>Dr . Benjamin said in the White House Rose Garden announcement that the deaths of close relatives from preventable diseases drove her to focus on public health . <p/>\"My father died with diabetes and hypertension . <p/>My older brother , and only sibling , died at age 44 of HIV - related illness . <p/>My mother died of lung cancer , because as a young girl , she wanted to smoke just like her twin brother could . \" <p/>Dr . Collins' colleagues said he is a natural choice to head the primary federal agency for funding and conducting medical research because of his thoughtfulness , willingness to listen and experience as a spokesman for the genome mapping effort . <p/>\"He's a forceful personality , \" said Tom Murray , PhD , head of the Hastings Center , an independent bioethics research institute . <p/>\"He wants to hear from people who don't agree with him . \" <p/>Patients before profits <p/>If confirmed , Dr . Benjamin would be the nation's lead public health educator . <p/>Fellow physicians see the role as a good fit . <p/>Besides experience with family illnesses , Dr . Benjamin said she also was influenced by her medical school training under David Satcher , MD , PhD , who later became surgeon general , and others who focused on public health issues in underserved areas . <p/>Jorge Alsip , MD , the Alabama medical society's president , said Dr . Benjamin has seen how much patients in poor and rural areas appreciate her help . <p/>\"That can't help but affect you and make you want to do something for these people , \" said Dr . Alsip , an emergency physician who has known Dr . Benjamin for more than 15 years . <p/>Dr . Alsip also said Dr . Benjamin is tenacious . <p/>\"If Regina's in a fight , don't ever bet against her . \" <p/>She rebuilt her clinic in Bayou La Batre , Ala . , twice after hurricanes destroyed it and is rebuilding it a third time after a fire . <p/>Obama said his surgeon general pick has personally witnessed how the U . S . health system is broken . <p/>\"She's seen an increasing number of patients who've had health insurance their entire lives suddenly lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simply become too expensive . \" <p/>Dr . Benjamin lamented the difficulty some doctors face in caring for patients , regardless of ability to pay . <p/>\"It shouldn't be this expensive for Americans to get health care in this country , \" she said . <p/>Obama said Dr . Benjamin has forgone a salary when her clinic faced financial hardship . <p/>Jeff Terry , MD , chair of the AMA's Alabama delegation and a urologist , said Dr . Benjamin has proven herself through work in organized medicine and elsewhere . <p/>The two co - founded the young physicians section of the state medical society nearly two decades ago . <p/>Since then , she has held leadership positions in physician organizations and other groups . <p/>Dr . Benjamin is also probably more politically liberal than many physicians on Alabama's Gulf Coast , Dr . Terry said . <p/>\"Maybe President Obama saw a little of that in her . \" <p/>Both scientific and religious <p/>Obama lauded Dr . Collins' experience in the July 8 announcement . <p/>\"Dr . Collins is one of the top scientists in the world , and his groundbreaking work has changed the very ways we consider our health and examine disease . \" <p/>Dr . Collins' laboratory discovered several important genes , including those responsible for cystic fibrosis and Huntington's disease . <p/>Acquaintances and colleagues predicted that Dr . Collins would do a good job representing NIH in front of lawmakers and others . <p/>He is a very approachable person who doesn't rely on jargon to communicate , said Sean B . Tipton , spokesman for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine . <p/>\"He has an ability to interact with the public and with policymakers and the press that I think will serve him very well as an NIH director . \" <p/>The Hastings Center's Murray said that if Dr . Collins ever made a mistake , it may be that he was a bit overly enthusiastic when describing the potential for breakthroughs when he was leading the Human Genome Project . <p/>Still , \"I can't fault the scientist who really believes in their work for being enthusiastic as they talk to Congress , \" Murray said . <p/>Dr . Collins has garnered attention by professing that his belief in God can coexist with his pursuit of science . <p/>He's written books on the topic , including the 2007 best - seller The Language of God : A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief . <p/>He is also founder and president of the BioLogos Foundation , whose purpose is to find compatibility between the scientific and religious searches for truth . <p/>In an interview with the spiritual Web site Beliefnet in 2007 , Dr . Collins said Christians who reject scientific evolutionary theory are also rejecting humans' ability to understand , a God - given skill . <p/>But there are limits to the questions science can answer , such as why we are here or what happens after death , he said . <p/>William Hurlbut , MD , a consulting professor of neuroscience at Stanford University and a former member of President George W . Bush's Council on Bioethics , said the idea that science and religion can't coexist is ridiculous . <p/>\"A person with Francis' background is a very wise choice\" for NIH chief , he said ."

'' <p/>The Indian navy defended its actions , saying it had fired in self-defense . <p/>Somali pirates have become increasingly brazen and recently seized a Saudi supertanker loaded with $ 100 million of crude oil . <p/>Many of the vessels are taken to pirate-controlled regions in Somalia , where they are held for ransom . <p/>It was not immediately clear what would happen to the pirates captured by the Indians , or where they would be taken . <p/>The statement said only that the prisoners and their weapons would be `` handed over to appropriate authorities ashore . '' <p/>Most foreign navies patrolling the Somali coast have been reluctant to detain suspects because of uncertainties over where they would face trial , since Somalia has no effective central government or legal system . <p/>Also on Saturday , a German military spokesman said a navy frigate had chased away pirates in speedboats pursuing an Ethiopian freighter off the coast of Yemen . <p/>The German frigate responded to a distress call from the freighter , and a helicopter took off from the deck to investigate . <p/>The pirates turned away from the freighter as the helicopter flew overhead , said the spokesman , who declined to give his name in line with military policy . <p/>An estimated 1,500 pirates are based in Somalia 's semiautonomous Puntland region , raking in millions of dollars . <p/>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will present a draft Security Council resolution next week asking the United Nations to authorize `` all necessary measures '' against piracy from Somalia . <p/>However , the commander of the U.S. Navy 's 5th Fleet expressed doubt Friday about the wisdom of launching attacks against Somali pirates on land , as the draft proposes . <p/>U.S. Vice Adm. Bill Gortney told reporters that it is difficult to identify pirates , and the potential for killing innocent civilians `` can not be overestimated . '' <p/>The threat of pirates recently prompted a German cruise ship to evacuate some 420 passengers and crew after the company decided not to risk their safety as the ship passed through the Gulf of Aden . <p/>The passengers and crew have rejoined the M/S Columbus - which is on a six-month round-the-world trip - in Oman 's port of Salalah after three days in Dubai , Hamburg-based cruise operator Hapag-Lloyd said Saturday . <p/>The ship and a limited crew made it through the gulf without incident , a company spokeswoman said ."

  "marked_doc": "Jackson arrested on DUI charge <p/>Despite his arrest on <mark id=\"mark_id\"> suspicion </mark> of driving under the influence early yesterday , Chargers receiver Vincent Jackson will play in Sunday 's AFC divisional playoff game at Pittsburgh . <p/>Jackson , 25 , was driving east on state Route 52 near Interstate 805 just after 2:30 a.m. when he was pulled over for an observed traffic violation , California Highway Patrol Officer Brad Baehr said . <p/>Jackson faces the misdemeanor DUI allegation as well as charges that he was driving on probation for a prior DUI in June 2006 , Baehr said . <p/>The results of a blood test are pending . <p/>Jackson proffered his innocence in a statement released yesterday afternoon . <p/>`` This morning I was stopped by an officer , '' Jackson said in the statement . <p/>`` I do n't think any charges will be filed as a result of the stop . <p/>In the event they are , I look forward to clearing my name and proving my innocence . '' <p/>The arrest will not affect Jackson 's status for Sunday 's game . <p/>The NFL 's collective bargaining agreement gives the league , not teams , authority to punish players for alcohol and substance abuses . <p/>Any discipline by the league would be meted out for the 2009 season , several sources said . <p/>A suspension certainly is possible . <p/>The NFL 's substance-abuse policy states : `` Discipline for a second or subsequent offense is likely to be a suspension , the duration of which may escalate for repeat offenses . '' <p/>Jared Allen , then with Kansas City , was suspended for the first four games of the 2007 season after being charged with DUI twice in one year . <p/>The NFL later reduced his suspension to two games . <p/>Chargers players had the day off yesterday . <p/>General Manager A.J. Smith issued the following statement on Jackson 's arrest : <p/>`` We 're aware of the off-the-field issue involving Vincent . <p/>Obviously , we 're disappointed . <p/>We take these issues very seriously . <p/>Moving forward , we will monitor the situation and have no further comment . '' <p/>Jackson was driving a 2008 GMC Sierra registered to him , Baehr said . <p/>He was booked into county jail and was released by 6 a.m. , Baehr said . <p/>Jackson , in his fourth season , caught a career-high 59 passes and led the team with 1,098 yards , also a career high . <p/>His seven receiving touchdowns were also a career best and second on the team . <p/>Earlier this week , Smith called Jackson a `` true professional '' and `` ultimate team player '' for how hard Jackson played even while not catching any passes . <p/>`` You win championships with players like Vincent Jackson , '' Smith said . <p/>The general manager has put an emphasis on character and avoiding off-the-field issues . <p/>The Chargers have not had any arrests become public this season and have been relatively trouble-free in recent years . <p/>In 2006 , linebacker Steve Foley was shot by an off-duty Coronado policeman who suspected Foley of driving under the influence . <p/>Foley pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drunken driving and was placed on five years ' probation . <p/>In July , he settled a lawsuit against the city of Coronado for $ 5.5 million . <p/>Jackson 's contract runs through 2009 , and he is among the hottest young receivers in the league . <p/>What becomes of this incident , combined with the previous DUI , could affect Jackson 's long-term future with the Chargers . <p/>Smith has let go a number of players who have had off-the-field troubles . <p/>While none was as productive or possessed the upside of Jackson , Smith did last February release tackle Shane Olivea just two years after signing Olivea to a contract that guaranteed him $ 9 million . <p/>Olivea later underwent treatment for an addiction to pain killers . <p/>`` You 're a Charger one year at a time , '' Smith has often said . <p/>Recently , speaking of the lack of incidents involving his players , Smith said , `` It 's very important if you want to be a Charger you do the right things on and off the field . '' <p/>The Chargers leave Friday for Pittsburgh , where they will face the Steelers at 1:45 p.m. Sunday ."

He bleeds Philadelphia , \" team president Billy King said . <p/>Cheeks will be introduced as Philadelphia's 21st head coach at a Tuesday news conference . <p/>Philadelphia is certainly banking on the former point guard to have a happier homecoming than O'Brien , a Philadelphia native who played for Saint Joseph's . <p/>O'Brien's stubbornness and seemingly unwavering belief in a system that didn't fit his players cost him his job despite a 43 - 39 record and a return to the playoffs . <p/>\"I just felt the direction we were going and the overall play wasn't where we wanted to go , \" King said . <p/>O'Brien just finished the first year of a three - year deal that included an option and paid him about $4 million a year . <p/>O'Brien , though , was not very popular with his players - - most notably former All - Star Chris Webber - - who often complained about their roles . <p/>King said after the Sixers were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Detroit that he planned to bring O'Brien back . <p/>After meeting with his players and other members of management , King had a change of heart and decided over the weekend he had to make a change . <p/>Certainly , King knows a thing or two about making changes - - Cheeks will be the fifth Sixers coach in four years under his watch . <p/>Larry Brown left for Detroit following the 2002 - 03 season , and assistant Randy Ayers was promoted and fired 52 games into the 2003 - 04 season before he was replaced by Chris Ford . <p/>\"I knew this thing was coming , and it wasn't an easy thing for anybody , \" Brown said from Miami before coaching the Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals . <p/>\"Knowing Billy , it's not easy to let a coach go . <p/>His relationship with Randy was pretty strong . <p/>I think it was hard for him to let Chris go . <p/>He was excited about having Jimmy , but I don't think it ever gets easy . \" <p/>Cheeks was one of the most popular 76ers from 1978 - 89 and played on Philadelphia's last championship team in 1983 . <p/>He also spent seven seasons as an assistant coach for the 76ers , was part of the staff under Brown when they went to the NBA Finals in 2001 and developed a strong bond with Allen Iverson . <p/>Cheeks was fired March 2 after nearly four seasons as coach of the Trail Blazers . <p/>He had a 162 - 139 record in Portland , the fourth - highest win total in Blazers history . <p/>Cheeks guided the team to the playoffs his first two seasons , but the players hardly made Cheeks' tenure easy - - on or off the court . <p/>The team was nicknamed the \"Jail Blazers\" after several brushes with the law , many of them involving marijuana possession . <p/>\"If players have problems with Mo Cheeks . . . then there's got to be something wrong with those players , \" King said . <p/>But Cheeks' return to the city where he was a four - time All - Star shouldn't come as a surprise . <p/>The Trail Blazers turned down Philadelphia's request to speak to Cheeks as a possible replacement for Brown , but the former point guard always remained popular with Philly fans and was at the top of the Sixers' short list to take over for Ford . <p/>Now , they'll get their wish . <p/>\"We do not want to change coaches [ again ] , \" Sixers chairman Ed Snider said . <p/>\"We've seen enough coaches . \" <p/>The Sixers will pay Ayers , O'Brien and Cheeks next season . <p/>\"I don't think it's something we're very proud of , but I don't think it reflects poorly , \" Snider said . <p/>O'Brien is the son - in - law of Hall of Fame coach Jack Ramsay . <p/>He led the Sixers to a 10 - win improvement from a year ago and they returned to the playoffs , largely on the back of a healthy , happy Iverson . <p/>While O'Brien avoided public spats with Iverson , he did not have the full support of the rest of the team . <p/>Some of the younger players , like Samuel Dalembert and Willie Green , felt they did not develop like they should have under O'Brien and were unsure about their roles . <p/>\"In looking at the development of some of them , yeah , I wasn't pleased , \" King said . <p/>The Sixers also failed to really understand O'Brien's defense , a sticking point even in the postseason . <p/>\"Some of the criteria on our defense wasn't there , \" King said . <p/>Cheeks , who once famously came to the rescue of a 13 - year - old girl who forgot the words to the national anthem before a playoff game , now hopes to bail out his former team and bring them another championship . <p/>\"Mo has played this game here in Philadelphia , won a championship here in Philadelphia , understands players , understands defenses , understands the way I think we want to play , \" King said ."
