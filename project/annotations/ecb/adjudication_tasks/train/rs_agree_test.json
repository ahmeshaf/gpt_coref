Palin , part of a Halloween display in a yard in Southern California . <p/>The governor of California did nothing , the mayor did nothing , and the neighbors thought it was `` cool . '' <p/>This effigy was a likeness of a woman swinging by a noose in someone 's yard ! <p/>Where was the outrage ? <p/>Then there are those who have blasted the governor for her daughter 's pregnancy . <p/>Both have been brutally criticized , belittled and shamed . <p/>Children will do what they want as teenagers ; <p/>we parents try our best to instill good morals and values . <p/>Palin 's daughter 's upbringing has nothing to do with who our governor is or what she believes . <p/>I was appalled to hear comments like , `` Well , she put herself in the limelight , so she deserved what she got . '' <p/>There have also been those who have asked if the governor is really Trig 's mom ? <p/>Where has the fair and balanced reporting been on that `` story '' ? <p/>It is one thing to disagree with Sarah Palin 's views or beliefs , but to tear her and her family apart to make you feel more superior , to make you feel good about your hatred , anger and lack of Christianity , that is appalling . <p/>I do hope Palin 's church was not torched because of her beliefs . <p/>She and her family have never done anything to warrant the outlandish actions from her insensitive critics .",

  "marked_doc": "Now that Fulton County courthouse killer Brian Nichols has been sentenced to life without parole , one of the not yet answered questions is where the 37-year-old will <mark id=\"mark_id\"> serve </mark> time . <p/>Superior Court Judge James Bodiford on Saturday suggested that Nichols should serve his time in the federal maximum security prison - known as Supermax - in Florence , Colo. , which has the reputation as the nation 's toughest and most secure prison . <p/>Bodiford said he was surprised to learn during the trial that Nichols , who is committed of state crimes , could still serve his time in a federal prison . <p/>`` I thought maybe Supermax might be a good place for Mr. Nichols for what it is worth , '' Bodiford said . <p/>`` I do n't believe I can order it and I am not going to order it but that is my two cents worth . '' <p/>About the prison: <p/>The supermax unit at the Florence Federal Correctional Complex at Florence , Colo. , primarily holds extremely dangerous or escape-risk federal inmates . <p/>There also are a few state prisoners there who need more security than those prisons can provide . <p/>The remote prison , which opened in 1994 , almost disappears into the same-color desert around it . <p/>Cells are 8-by-12 feet , with concrete walls , ceilings and furnishings , including the bed . <p/>The toilets , sinks and showers are stainless steel . <p/>Cell windows are long and narrow , limiting the view to only the sky . <p/>Some known inmates: <p/>Unabomber Ted Kaczynski , shoe bomber Richard Reid , and Sept. 11 , 2001 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui . <p/>Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin , the 1960s militant once named H. Rap Brown , convicted in Georgia of the state crime of murdering a Fulton County deputy . <p/>Convicted of federal crimes in Georgia : Eric Robert Rudolph , who pleaded guilty to the Centennial Olympic Park bombings and other bombings in Atlanta , and Malachi Z. York , the Nuwaubian leader convicted of child molestation , racketeering and federal financial reporting charges . <p/>Prison program: <p/>A three-step program limits - or perhaps deprives - inmates of many things that would stimulate the senses - smell , sight and touch . <p/>Olympic Park bomber Rudolph complained in letters to a Colorado newspaper in 2006 that the prison 's design was driving him insane . <p/>In the first stage of the program , inmates spend 23 of every 24 hours double-locked behind a steel door and a barred grate . <p/>They are allowed one 15-minute telephone call a month . <p/>One hour each day is spent alone in a recreation area . <p/>Their behavior is reviewed every 90 days before they can be moved up to the next step . <p/>At the second and third steps , inmates are given progressively more freedom , more time for exercise , longer and more frequent telephone calls and more social contact with other prisoners - as long as they are free of violations . <p/>Limited inmate privileges: <p/>Inmates get a radio and a black-and-white , 13-inch television made specially with clear backs that reveal all internal components . <p/>The TVs are hooked up to `` basic cable . '' <p/>Inmates participate in religious services that are broadcast on their televisions . <p/>Guards pass inmates ' meals , law books and other items through a slot in the door . <p/>There is limited direct human contact .",

  "marked_doc": "http : / / whiteandbluereview . com / ? p=22999 <p/>Ott \u2019 s Thoughts : Creighton Returns to MVC Semis With <mark id=\"mark_id\"> Win </mark> Over Drake <p/>Posted on March 09 , 2013 <p/>The roar . <p/>My goodness , the roar . <p/>Take approximately 7 , 000 Creighton hoops fans . <p/>Ply them with a cocktail or two . <p/>Heap a few heavy dashes of high expectations for the weekend , and shake it all up with one big sense of being on vacation . <p/>That concoction looks like a blue - out in the Scottrade Center . <p/>It sounds like an overwhelming tidal wave of blue - clad crazies crashing onto the hard court after every Doug McDermott make and terrible officiating call . <p/>Creighton fans overtook the turnstiles in St . Louis Friday afternoon . <p/>They came from all over the Midwest and beyond to see CU win the weekend , and the Bluejays obliged the first of three requisite wins for an Arch Madness championship . <p/>Drake put up a fight ; the Bulldogs twice cut Creighton \u2019 s lead to 3 points midway through the second half . <p/>But a 15 - 2 run during 5 minutes late in the game sealed the deal for the Jays , who will meet Indiana State in the semifinals Saturday afternoon after the Sycamores outlasted Evansville 51 - 50 Friday . <p/>Creighton \u2019 s win over Drake was historic for a few reasons , chief among them McDermott setting the Creighton career scoring record . <p/>McDermott scored 10 of the team \u2019 s first 17 points , displaying a mix of three - point touch and the ability to finish around the rim . <p/>You know , classic Dougie Fresh . <p/>Those 10 points tied McDermott with Rodney Buford , Creighton \u2019 s all - time leading scorer . <p/>And as those of us in the crowd who paid attention to such things held off on a bathroom or beer trip to watch him score one more point to break the record , McDermott wouldn \u2019 t do so for another 8 minutes of game time . <p/>Still , it was inevitable . <p/>And a bit anticlimactic , frankly , when he toed the free throw line and set the record with a one - for - two trip to the charity stripe . <p/>Still , that McDermott broke Rodzilla \u2019 s record in just three seasons is wild to me . <p/>I \u2019 m lucky to say I \u2019 ve been able to watch McDermott , Buford , Bob Harstad , and Chad Gallagher \u2014 the school \u2019 s top four scorers in history \u2014 during my time on Earth cheering for the Jays . <p/>But had you told me after that NCAA Tournament game in 1999 that Buford \u2019 s record would be bested by a guy in only three seasons , I \u2019 d have called you nuts . <p/>Or , as the kids around the Valley type on Twitter right now , #nutz . <p/>As for the entirety of his afternoon , McDermott was usual Dependable Doug . <p/>With a building full of NBA scouts hanging on his moves ( and , later , on Illinois State \u2019 s Jackie Carmichael \u2019 s ridiculous individual performance ) , McDermott scored 23 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in 35 minutes . <p/>He left the court to chants of \u201c ONE MORE YEAR ! ONE MORE YEAR ! ONE MORE YEAR ! \u201d <p/>Indeed . <p/>But for all of McDermott \u2019 s historic accomplishments and his game - high scoring output , the storyline from the CU side of things was the combined play of Gregory Echenique and Will Artino . <p/>Echenique hadn \u2019 t scored much in two games against Drake earlier this season : he put up just 2 points in a 30 - point CU win in Omaha , and then battled foul trouble all night in Des Moines as Drake upset CU . <p/>And he went scoreless in the first half Friday . <p/>But up stepped Artino , Echenique \u2019 s sub when the CU coaching staff goes in favor of size and a high / low game instead of Ethan Wragge \u2019 s shooting touch from deep . <p/>Friday afternoon , Artino gave the Bluejays 14 energized and efficient minutes . <p/>Entering February , he had played double - digit minutes in just six games . <p/>Since the calendar flipped from January , though , he \u2019 s had five such games . <p/>Friday was arguably his most important performance of the season , given the stakes . <p/>Artino checked in at the under - 16 : 00 media timeout and immediately broke a 12 - 12 tie with a dunk . <p/>Fouled on the flush , he finished the traditional three - point play with a free throw . <p/>Two trips later , Artino missed a shot but secured the follow and scored again . <p/>He would grab two more rebounds before checking out with 9 : 07 to play in the first half . <p/>While he was in , Creighton \u2019 s lead grew as great as 9 points . <p/>In 8 first - half minutes , the guy teammates and fans call Big Swag scored 7 points and ripped down 5 rebounds . <p/>He played the high - low possessions well . <p/>While Drake held Echenique scoreless in the first half , Artino was able to find success . <p/>He finished the day with a career - high 14 points and 6 rebounds ( 5 on the offensive glass ) . <p/>In the second half , though , Echenique got , um , engaged with things . <p/>He scored all 11 of his points , grabbed 6 of his team - high 11 rebounds , and swatted 5 of his season - high 6 blocked shots ( the 6 blocks are second - most in an MVC Tournament game ) . <p/>During the game \u2019 s deciding 15 - 2 run , Echenique scored two traditional three - point plays , grabbed 3 of his 11 rebounds , and blocked two shots . <p/>Hammered on a no - call and forced to play at a disadvantage based on inconsistent referring in the frontcourt , Echenique seemed fired up . <p/>He flexed a few times , too , so as to remind the Bulldogs who the alpha dog in the paint was on Friday afternoon . <p/>The tournament \u2019 s top seed sticks around for Semifinal Saturday . <p/>The 1998 Bradley Braves remains the only play - in winner to advance past the quarterfinals , when they beat a two - seeded Creighton team . <p/>Wichita State survived a close game against Missouri State Friday evening , and Illinois State broke away late from Northern Iowa to advance as the six - seed . <p/>The Valley will have four solid fan bases represented in the Scottrade Center Saturday afternoon , with white and blue and black and gold the predominant colors swirling around the lower bowl . <p/>The day sets up for some solid matchups : <p/>The last time the two teams played , Indiana State made Creighton look completely lost . <p/>A blacked out crowd in Terre Haute helped the Sycamores to a resounding win . <p/>Meanwhile , it took a Carmichael karate kick and other late - game miscues for Illinois State to practically hand over a win to Wichita State in Normal .",

LaRue , a top Nixon campaign official who passed money from a secret White House fund to <mark id=\"mark_id\"> buy </mark> the silence of the Watergate burglars , died Saturday at a hotel in Biloxi , Miss . <p/>He was 75 . <p/>His heart failed while he was reading a book , his son , Ike LaRue III , said . <p/>He lived in Biloxi and Jackson , Miss . <p/>Fred LaRue's career was intertwined with that of Richard M . Nixon from the time he transferred his considerable financial support to Nixon from the defeated presidential candidate Barry Goldwater in 1964 . <p/>He was an architect of Nixon's successful strategy for capturing Southern votes and then a significant participant in the Watergate scandal . <p/>Mr . LaRue pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in July 1973 . <p/>He served a reduced sentence of four and a half months in federal prison in return for cooperating with prosecutors investigating the break - in at the Watergate complex , which housed the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee , on June 17 , 1972 . <p/>He was at the meeting in Key Biscayne , Fla . , on March 30 , 1972 , where John N . Mitchell , the former attorney general who became head of Nixon's re - election campaign committee , and Jeb Stuart Magruder , Mr . Mitchell's deputy , approved a \"dirty tricks\" campaign , including the Watergate break - in . <p/>Mr . LaRue was also at the meeting after the break - in at which some of the same officials scurried to come up with money for the burglars . <p/>Mr . LaRue personally delivered payments . <p/>Nixon acknowledged his own involvement in the cover - up , but always denied advance knowledge of the break - in . <p/>In a heated exchange with Mr . Magruder in 2003 , Mr . LaRue supported Nixon's claim of ignorance of the initial burglary . <p/>Mr . LaRue's main argument was that he had been in charge of the phone at a Florida meeting of the top campaign staff where the break - in was planned and was monitoring all calls . <p/>Nixon never called , he said in an interview with The Sun Herald , a Biloxi newspaper . <p/>Also , he said his personal relationship with Mitchell was so close that Mitchell would certainly have told him . <p/>Mr . LaRue denied suggestions that he was \"Deep Throat , \" the secret Watergate source used by Bob Woodward in his joint coverage of the scandal with Carl Bernstein for The Washington Post . <p/>Mr . LaRue said he believed the secret informer was an amalgam of several people , but Mr . Woodward has said that it is one person and that he will reveal that person's identity after his death . <p/>Mr . LaRue , whose family amassed a fortune in the oil business , played an important role with Nixon many years before Watergate . <p/>After contributing heavily to Goldwater's losing presidential campaign in 1964 , he became a leading supporter of Nixon . <p/>In particular , he helped develop a \"Southern strategy\" for the Republicans to recapture Southern states from the Democrats . <p/>After Nixon's election in 1968 , Mr . LaRue worked in the White House without title or salary . <p/>Partly through his friendship with Senator James O . Eastland , the Mississippi Democrat who was chairman of the Judiciary Committee , Mr . LaRue helped to win confirmation for Nixon's nominees to the federal bench . <p/>\"He was an elusive , anonymous , secret operator at the highest levels of the shattered Nixon power structure , \" The New York Times reported in 1973 . <p/>\"He is a man of personal mystery , too - a latter - day character , it sometimes seemed , out of a Southern gothic novel . \" <p/>Frederick Cheney LaRue was born Oct . 11 , 1928 , in Athens , Tex . <p/>His father , Ike Parsons LaRue Sr . , whom Fred LaRue shot and killed in a Canadian duck - hunting accident in 1957 , was a first cousin of Sid Richardson , the Texas oil and ranching tycoon . <p/>The elder Mr . LaRue had gone to jail for banking violations and moved to Mississippi to look for oil . <p/>His company discovered the giant Bolton field , which Fred's generation sold for $30 million in 1967 . <p/>Fred LaRue spread money to local and national politicians , and , despite his shyness , acquired the nickname Bubba . <p/>He became a Republican national committeeman . <p/>In the end , Mr . LaRue was one of the first top Nixon aides to cooperate with prosecutors . <p/>\"LaRue had stressed that it was time for both of us to think about protecting ourselves and our families instead of continuing to worry about protecting Mitchell and the president , \" Mr . Magruder wrote in his 1974 book , \"An American Life : One Man's Road to Watergate . \" <p/>Mr . LaRue is survived by his wife , Joyce Burleson LaRue ; his sons Ike III , of Jackson , and Fred Jr . , of Brandon , Miss . ; his daughters Patricia LaRue of Arlington , Tex . , Leslie LaRue of Manhattan , Grace Burleson LaRue of Crystal Springs , Miss . ; his brother , Ike Jr . ; his sister , Ruthie LaRue Owen of Jackson ; and nine grandchildren . <p/>In the interview with The Sun Herald , Mr . LaRue guessed that the healthy regimen of his months in prison added 10 years to his life . <p/>\"The warden let me make a badminton court out of the volleyball court , \" he said . <p/>\"We had some of the best badminton players in the country . \"",

most yards in franchise history and the defense played well for 55 minutes of the game , the Chiefs lost to the Indianapolis Colts , 20 - 13 , and kept their grip on the #1 pick in the <mark id=\"mark_id\"> 2013 NFL Draft </mark> . <p/>By beating the Chiefs , Indianapolis \u2019 record rose to 9 - 5 and they locked up a playoff spot just one season after posting the worst record in the NFL in 2011 \u2013 a Chiefs - like 2 - 14 mark . <p/>Meanwhile , the Chiefs lost their 13th game of the season and could tie the franchise mark of 14 losses next week in Denver against Peyton Manning and the Broncos . <p/>The 2008 Chiefs ended the season with a 2 - 14 record . <p/>On the only positive note for the game , the Chiefs had two players rush for over 100 yards apiece \u2013something that hasn \u2019 t happened to the franchise since 1991 . <p/>Jamaal Charles ( 226 yards ) and Peyton Hillis ( 101 yards ) led a powerful attack that , for any team other than the 2012 Chiefs , would have nearly guaranteed a victory . <p/>KC ended the game with 352 net yards rushing . <p/>The 1961 Dallas Texans rushed for 398 yards against Houston ( 10 / 1 / 61 ) and the \u2019 66 squad gained 380 yards rushing against Denver ( 10 / 23 / 66 ) . <p/>But this year \u2019 s team was undone again by three turnovers , a missed field goal , and untimely penalties that wiped out scoring drives . <p/>Brady Quinn threw two interceptions , both of which had a devastating effect on the Chiefs . <p/>The first occurred on Kansas City \u2019 s opening drive when Quinn threw behind receiver Dexter McCluster and Colts cornerback , Darius Butler , picked it off and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown , putting Indy up 7 - 0 . <p/>Quinn \u2019 s second interception of the game came at a crucial point in the 4th quarter with the team trailing 13 - 10 and with the ball at the Indy 14 - yard line . <p/>Quinn underthrew a pass in the end zone to receiver Jon Baldwin and was picked off by Vontae Davis for an Indianapolis touchback . <p/>Yet another potential scoring opportunity blown for the Chiefs . <p/>Quinn threw a third interception \u2013 and his second to Davis in consecutive series \u2013 but it was overturned when Davis was called for pass interference . <p/>Any honest Chiefs fan would say that it was the most \u201c phantom \u201d interference penalty ever as Davis never appeared to touch KC receiver Jamar Newsome . <p/>Kicker Ryan Succop showed his Jekyll / Hyde nature in the first quarter by nailing a 47 - yard field goal that looked good the moment he kicked it , but then missing a 43 - yarder that would have made the score 7 - 6 . <p/>Towards the end of the first half , Charles made his only mistake of the day by fumbling at the Indianapolis 16 - yard line , snuffing out another scoring opportunity with the Chiefs behind 10 - 3 . <p/>The Colts turned the fumble into another field goal and went into halftime leading KC , 13 - 3 . <p/>As the second half opened , the Chiefs looked like they were going to go into self - destruct mode again when return man , Devon Wylie , inexplicably tried to return the second - half kickoff from deep in his own end zone and was swarmed under at the 14 - yard line by Indy . <p/>The few Chiefs fans remaining in the stands undoubtedly thought about going home early and getting a head start on dinner . <p/>( Personal note : Somebody on the special teams \u2019 coaching staff needs to put leg chains on Wylie , who apparently thinks he is former All - Pro return man , Dante Hall . <p/>Wylie brings out EVERY kick and more often than not , doesn \u2019 t get the ball back to the 20 - yard line . ) <p/>But , showing why he is the best player on the team , Charles took a handoff around the left end and with some terrific downfield blocking by Baldwin , romped 86 yards for the Chiefs first touchdown in nine quarters of football \u2013 ironically since Charles \u2019 80 - yard TD run on the opening play of the Cleveland game two weeks ago . <p/>Colts \u2013 13 , Chiefs \u2013 10 and a new ballgame . <p/>Both defenses tightened up in the second half , but the key play of the game came with 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter and the score tied 13 - 13 . <p/>The Chiefs faced a 4th - and - inches at the Indy 27 - yd line , but despite having Hillis and Charles in the backfield , coaches Romeo Crennel and offensive coordinator Brian Daboll decided to have Quinn try a quarterback sneak . <p/>Quinn was stopped short and the Colts took the ball over on downs . <p/>It was here that Chiefs fans could see what might have been had they had this awful season LAST YEAR when Colts QB Andrew Luck was the top prize of the draft . <p/>Luck had struggled all day long under pressure from the Chiefs defense and the rookie looked very ordinary . <p/>However , when it counted , he looked like Joe Montana . <p/>Luck calmly led the Colts on a 13 - play drive that culminated in a laser - like TD throw to Reggie Wayne that put the Colts up 20 - 13 . <p/>I say that Chiefs fans could only dream of having Luck because if there was ever an indictment of the Chiefs QB situation , it came on the next series of downs . <p/>With four minutes left in the game , Wylie AGAIN brought the kick - off out of the end zone and was tackled at the 10 - yard line . <p/>( Seriously \u2026 somebody cut him now . ) <p/>With 90 yards to go and two time outs ( plus the two - minute warning ) in their pocket the Chiefs put a big red ribbon on this turd of a season for fans by running the following \u201c game - winning \u201d plays : <p/>1st - and - 10 \u2013 Quinn pass incomplete short right to Steve Maneri <p/>2nd - and - 10 \u2013 Jamaal Charles up middle for 2 yards <p/>3rd - and - 8 \u2013 ( Shotgun formation ) Peyton Hillis around right end for - 2 yards <p/>4th - and - 10 \u2013 Dustin Colquitt punt <p/>So on a day when at least nine NFL quarterbacks threw for 300 yards or more ( and three threw for 400+ ) , the Chiefs wouldn \u2019 t let their #1 quarterback attempt to win a game with his arm . <p/>One could only assume it \u2019 s because the odds of Jamaal Charles ripping off another 90 - yard run was more likely than any of the stiffs playing QB for the Chiefs leading a game - winning drive . <p/>Then , like the Grinch that really wanted to screw the fans' holidays , the defense couldn \u2019 t stop the Colts offense as Indy easily picked up a first down and ran out the clock . <p/>Luckily for KC fans , the final indignities of the season will end next week when the free agent QB that infamously spurned the Chiefs , Peyton Manning , leads his 12 - 3 Broncos against KC in what may be Romeo Crennel and Scott Pioli \u2019 s last games with the Chiefs . <p/>Manning and the Broncos have a legitimate shot at getting the #1 seed in the AFC for the playoffs , so they won't be resting anyone for the last game . <p/>Well , at least not until Denver is up by four touchdowns , which may be halftime .",

Burnett , so it appears unlikely they would make a grab for Teixeira as well . <p/>Boras also represents free - agent catcher Jason Varitek , the Red Sox captain who declined an offer of salary arbitration from the team . <p/>Boston has not made another offer to Varitek since , though the sides continue to talk . <p/>A third Boras client , free - agent pitcher Derek Lowe , also is of interest to the Red Sox , but they have not made him an offer and are expected to do so only if he drops his price . <p/>Lowe is believed to be seeking a five - year deal in the $75 million range . <p/>Teixeira , who turns 29 on April 11 , has averaged more than 30 home runs and 100 RBIs in his six big - league seasons , while posting a . 919 OPS and playing Gold Glove - caliber defense . <p/>The Red Sox envision him as a middle - of - the - lineup presence to offset last July \u2019 s departure of Manny Ramirez to the Dodgers . <p/>If Teixeira signs with the Red Sox , they would move All - Star Kevin Youkilis from first to third base while looking to trade third baseman Mike Lowell , the 2007 World Series MVP .",

\" <p/>Presidential guards , who usually stand immobile in front of the assembly building , left their posts as the clashes worsened . <p/>\"Our country is on the edge of the abyss , \" Greek President Karolos Papoulias said in a statement . <p/>\"We are all responsible so that it does not take the step into the void . \" <p/>The marchers had dispersed by late afternoon , leaving streets littered with burnt out garbage containers . <p/>Dozens of shop windows were smashed , including a bookstore near the burnt bank . <p/>Two other buildings besides the bank were set on fire . <p/>Police said 18 people had been injured in the violence and 12 arrested for carrying weapons and resisting authorities . <p/>BLOW TO GOVERNMENT <p/>The EU and IMF aid was intended to calm markets and give the government time to overhaul the economy and bring down a deficit that totalled 13 . 6 percent of national economic output last year . <p/>But the euro currency and Greek assets have been pummelled by concern that social unrest could thwart government plans to push through the measures , and on fears that Greece's woes could spread to other euro zone countries such as Portugal and Spain . <p/>In past months anti - austerity protests had been fairly peaceful , but Wednesday's violence was similar to that seen in the December 2008 riots , which broke out when police killed a teenager and dragged on for weeks . <p/>Wednesday's strike grounded flights , shut shops and brought public transport to a standstill and the main public sector union ADEDY said it was planning more walkout for next week . <p/>\"The big participation in the strike today and the crowds that flooded the streets of Athens . . . sent a message to the government : We will not let the EU and the IMF measures pass , \" said Ilias Vrettakos , deputy head of the union . <p/>Apostolos Kolokythopoulos , a 70 - year old pensioner who lives on less than 1 , 000 euros a month , said the walkouts were needed to force the government to change course . <p/>\"I agree with the strikes . <p/>If people don't react , don't protest , how will things change ? \" he said . <p/>Centre - left daily Eleftherotypia warned young Greeks would rise up if nothing was done to give them hope of a future . <p/>\"If nothing is done , the explosion of the angry and the disappointed will sweep everything away , \" the paper said . <p/>\"Have we forgotten December 2008 and become complacent ? \"",

Bush enacted several highly controversial policies that affect health care and wildlife . <p/>In just a little over a month in office , President Barack Obama has sidelined or overturned several of them , and has also reached back over the years to reverse policies enacted during Bush \u2019 s first term . <p/>A Bush administration draft plan to allow oil and gas drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts was sidelined by the Obama administration on Feb . 10 . <p/>\"To establish an orderly process that allows us to make wise decisions based on sound information , we need to set aside\" the plan , said new Interior Secretary Ken Salazar who extended the public comment period on offshore drilling by six months . <p/>Obama has maintained that expanded offshore drilling should be part of a larger energy blueprint developed out in the open with Congress , not within the departments of Commerce and Interior Department alone . <p/>On Feb . 27 , the Obama administration announced its intention to reverse the so - called \u201c medical conscience \u201d rule , following a 30 - day comment period . <p/>The rule gave health care workers the right to refuse to participate in services they consider immoral . <p/>The rule was vaguely worded and extended the right to refuse service to everyone from receptionists and janitors to hospital executives and insurance company CEOs . <p/>Opponents considered the rule , which took effect the day before Obama \u2019 s inauguration , a thinly veiled maneuver to limit access to legal abortions , contraceptives , and living will directives . <p/>On March 3 , Obama overturned another 11th hour Bush regulation that weakened the Endangered Species Act and <mark id=\"mark_id\"> pitted federal agencies against </mark> each other . <p/>The regulation allowed federal agencies to sidestep scientific evidence gathered by U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service experts when launching construction projects that impact endangered wildlife . <p/>When overturning the regulation , Obama said he was restoring \"the scientific process to its rightful place at the heart of the Endangered Species Act , a process undermined by past administrations . \" <p/>The Obama administration will also move quickly to reverse some older Bush rulings . <p/>On January 30 , Obama signed an executive order rescinding a 2001 Bush policy change that barred U . S . financial aid to international organizations that provide or promote abortions . <p/>First implemented by President Reagan and called the \u201c Mexico City \u201d rule , the policy is reversed whenever there is a change in ideology in the White House . <p/>Obama said the policy toward international family planning \"has been used as a political wedge issue . \" <p/>He said his administration would \u201c initiate a fresh conversation on family planning , working to find areas of common ground to best meet the needs of women and families at home and around the world . \" <p/>The Obama administration plans to head off many of Bush \u2019 s midnight hour rules still in the pipeline before they take effect . <p/>On inauguration day , federal agency heads were sent a memo stating that they should freeze all Bush regulations in the pipeline . <p/>Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag followed up with a Jan . 21 memo giving agency heads these options for dealing with Bush - era \u201c rules which raise substantial questions of law or policy : \u201d extending the effective date of a rule , reopening the notice and comment period , issuing interim final rules , and deciding not to defend court challenges to Bush administration rules . <p/>For a partial list of Bush \u2019 s midnight regulations and their current status , visit ProPublica .",

J . <p/>He was known as \"Chin , \" and his moniker was often invoked by denizens of the Mafia underworld with a hand - to - chin gesture rather than a word , the better to foil police bugs . <p/>To the writers of headlines he was sometimes \"Daffy Don\" or \"the Oddfather\" for his habit of walking the streets of the West Village clad in a bathrobe , striped pyjamas , and slippers , while muttering incoherently . <p/>Federal prosecutors claimed it was an act , but it was not until 2003 , after more than three decades of faking mental illness , that Gigante admitted in court that he did it to avoid prosecution . <p/>His admission came as part of a plea deal on behalf of his son , Andrew , also convicted of mob - related activities . <p/>For two decades , Gigante was head of the Genovese crime family , which emerged as the largest of the five New York Mafia clans after decades of concerted federal prosecutions decimated its rivals . <p/>It was estimated that there were some 300 members of the family under his control . <p/>The Genovese rackets included guaranteeing labor peace to firms in construction , garbage removal , and trucking ; extorting payoffs from companies doing business at the Ports of Newark and Elizabeth ; various rackets at the Fulton Fish Market and the Jacob K . Javits Convention Center ; contracts for window - installation in city housing , and the old standbys of bookmaking , loan - sharking , and narcotics . <p/>It was narcotics that first sent Gigante to prison , in 1959 , when he received a five - year sentence after being caught conspiring to smuggle heroin from abroad . <p/>Also sentenced in the case was the man who gave his name to the crime family , Vito Genovese . <p/>Genovese ran his organization from behind bars while serving a 15 - year sentence . <p/>It was a similar ruse - maintaining control of the family while incarcerated by transmitting orders through his son , Andrew - that was Gigante's downfall . <p/>Gigante was born in the Bronx to parents who were immigrants from Naples , Italy . <p/>His father was a jewelry engraver , and his mother was a seamstress . <p/>Born Vincenzo , he was called \"Chin\" for short , and his prominent chin probably helped the name stick . <p/>He put it to good use as a teenage boxer , winning 21 of 25 club fights . <p/>Gigante was arrested several times from when he was 17 to 25 , for possession of an unlicensed handgun , gambling , bookmaking , grand larceny , and arson . <p/>Two of his brothers , Mario and Ralph , were also identified as Mafia soldiers , while another , Louis , was a prominent Catholic priest as well as a Democratic politician in the Bronx . <p/>In 1957 Gigante was charged with attempted murder in the shooting of Frank Costello , then the head of what would be called the Genovese family . <p/>He was acquitted despite the testimony of a doorman who claimed to have witnessed the crime ; Costello himself claimed not to have seen his assailant , despite being shot at close range from the front . <p/>The shot had only \"creased his head , \" according to reports at the time . <p/>The prosecutor in the Costello case claimed that Gigante was \"a young punk on the way up in the underworld who was chosen to kill Costello to win his spurs . \" <p/>If so , it seemed to have worked , despite his having missed . <p/>Costello retired soon after , and Genovese assumed control of the family , which had a history going back to Lucky Luciano . <p/>After serving five years on the 1959 heroin conviction , Gigante resumed his life of crime . <p/>He first sought psychiatric help in 1966 , while under investigation for bribing New York City police . <p/>In 1970 , he was indicted for bribing the entire five - man police force of Old Tappan , N . J . , a small town in Bergen County where he had moved . <p/>After he produced evidence that he was under psychiatric care at St . Vincent's hospital in Westchester , the court ruled that he was mentally incompetent to testify in the case . <p/>It was a pattern Gigante would repeat in the coming decades , including committing himself several times when prosecutions threatened . <p/>Gigante's immediate family supported him , especially Louis , the glad - handing , cigar - smoking priest and builder of low - income housing , who told reporters his brother had paranoid schizophrenia , dementia , and Alzheimer's disease . <p/>Federal marshals serving him with a subpoena at his mother's Sullivan Street apartment house once found him standing under the shower , fully clothed , holding an umbrella . <p/>\"Vincenzo ? <p/>He is the boss of the toilet ! \" <p/>his mother told New York Post columnist Cindy Adams . <p/>Gigante , meantime , was consolidating his power within the Genovese family . <p/>In the late 1970s , he ran a crew in Lower Manhattan , operating waterfront rackets , as well as loan - sharking and gambling in New Jersey . <p/>He emerged as head of the Genovese family by the early 1980s . <p/>Federal prosecutors kept him under observation for decades , and Gigante kept up the crazy act with amazing consistency . <p/>He spent much of each day walking around the Village in his bed clothes and playing cards at his Triangle Civic Improvement Association on Mulberry Street . <p/>A sign hung on the wall warning business associates against loose talk : \"This place is bugged . \" <p/>By the late 1980s , he rarely went to Old Tappan , preferring to spend his nights on the Upper East Side with his mistress , with whom he had three children . <p/>Oddly , both his wife and his mistress were named Olympia . <p/>Gigante's mental illness act allowed him to escape trial despite being indicted numerous times on charges ranging from bid rigging and extortion to conspiracy to commit eight murders . <p/>His luck held until 1997 , when a New York jury found him guilty of a range of charges and sentenced him to 12 years in the federal penitentiary . <p/>It may have been a bad omen that the judge in the case , Jack B . Weinstein , insisted that Gigante wear a suit rather than a bathrobe to his trial . <p/>At the Palma Boys Social Club in East Harlem in 1985 , the FBI taped the following exchange between two Genovese family members , Anthony \"Fat Tony\" Salerno and Giuseppe Sabato : <p/>Salerno : He's got to worry if he gets pinched , all them years he spent in that [ expletive deleted ] asylum . <p/>Sabato : That's what I'm saying . <p/>Salerno : For nothing . <p/>Vincent L . Gigante <p/>Born March 29 , 1928 , in the Bronx ; died December 19 at the U . S . Medical Center for federal prisoners in Springfield , Mo . ; the cause of death was not announced , but he had recently suffered heart problems .",

Ray Peavy , a homicide investigator . <p/>Orozco , 27 , a known gang member , was also suspected of violating parole after serving time for a weapons violation , Peavy said . <p/>Ortiz , 35 , was on his own about 3 p . m . Friday when he went to a house in Hawaiian Gardens , a working - class city at the northeast border of Long Beach with long - standing gang problems . <p/>Peavy said the specific reason for Ortiz's visit was unknown but he provided a few details about the encounter : A woman answered the door and a man walked up behind her . <p/>Ortiz asked the man for some identification and was checking it when Orozco appeared from inside the house . <p/>He shot Ortiz once in the head and fled , Peavy said . <p/>Dozens of law enforcement officers worked the case through the afternoon and into the night , fanning out around the 12200 block of 223rd Street and questioning residents . <p/>Deputies believed they knew where Orozco was hiding and obtained a search warrant . <p/>A handgun was recovered during the arrest , Peavy said . <p/>Orozco , who was booked on suspicion of violating his parole , is being held without bail . <p/>Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Steve Cooley said he expected Orozco to be charged with first - degree murder of a peace officer , which means he could receive the death penalty if he is convicted . <p/>Peavy could not say what Orozco was doing in the house , but said he had been living on the street and sleeping in different places . <p/>Baca , who had been in Kentucky for a meeting of the National Sheriffs' Assn . , returned to Los Angeles for a news conference held Saturday with Cooley and Los Angeles Mayor - elect Antonio Villaraigosa . <p/>Baca praised the work of his investigators , but the arrest seemed to do little to quell his anger . <p/>He called Orozco \"the scum of the earth\" and an \"idiot , \" pointing to a photo of the suspect and the \"devil horns\" tattooed on his bald head . <p/>Cooley unfurled a long trail of printer paper that Baca said contained Orozco's criminal record , including drug and weapon violations , resisting arrest , burglary and assault with a deadly weapon . <p/>The sheriff contrasted the suspect's life with that of Ortiz , a 15 - year department veteran . <p/>Ortiz \"not only exemplified the best of what we have , but took it upon himself to work in the toughest job that we also have - - and that is trying to do something about this out - of - control gang problem in Los Angeles County , \" Baca said . <p/>Baca urged everyone in Southern California to pay more attention to the gang problem . <p/>He called for broader prevention initiatives , lamented the lack of resources in his department and urged parents to get involved in the lives of their children . <p/>Cooley said the fact that Orozco hadn't been in contact with his parole officer since January was a \"failure\" of the system , but he did not elaborate . <p/>Undersheriff Larry Waldie said that Ortiz set out without a partner Friday because he had arrived early and was eager to get to work . <p/>Peavy said Ortiz usually partnered with one of two deputies , but both had the day off . <p/>Instead , Ortiz had planned to partner with his sergeant . <p/>But he apparently decided to visit the house first . <p/>Peavy noted that such solo work is not a violation of department policy . <p/>Ortiz , of Diamond Bar , was an Army veteran and the father of two boys , ages 6 and 16 . <p/>He was married for the second time about two weeks ago . <p/>His family declined a request for an interview Saturday through a sheriff's spokesman . <p/>But colleagues described him as someone who lived for police work and was a \"fanatic\" about boxing . <p/>He fought on the sheriff's boxing team and trained recruits and deputies in hand - to - hand combat . <p/>Lt . Bob Rifkin of Operation Safe Streets , the department's gang unit , said Ortiz became interested in the gang problem while working as a patrol officer from 1996 to 2000 . <p/>He joined the gang unit in 2001 after passing a background check and written exam that tested his knowledge of gang culture . <p/>Ortiz won numerous commendations for his work . <p/>Last year , he was awarded the city of Lakewood's Medal of Valor after he fatally shot a carjacker who drew a gun on him and his partner . <p/>\"Jerry was 35 years old and had more motivation than a 21 - year - old just getting on the department , \" Rifkin said . <p/>\"He always wanted to go toward the action and that's what Jerry was respected for . \" <p/>Baca noted that Ortiz's family has had \"tremendous tragedies when it comes to those members who've been in law enforcement . \" <p/>In January , Ortiz's brother - in - law , Manuel A . Gonzalez , was stabbed to death while working as a corrections officer at a state prison in Chino . <p/>The alleged killer , Jon Christopher Blaylock , was serving a life sentence for the attempted murder of a police officer .",

He completed his first 17 passes . <p/>Meanwhile , inconsistency and an inability to score at the end of the game defined Jaguars quarterback David Garrard 's Thursday night . <p/>`` It 's a 60-minute game -- he played a really good game for 3 1/2 quarters , '' Colts defensive back Antoine Bethea said . <p/>The Jaguars led for three quarters , but 17 unanswered points in the fourth did them in . <p/>Manning <mark id=\"mark_id\"> completed </mark> 29 of 34 passes for 364 yards and 3 touchdowns in the Colts ' 31-24 victory over the Jaguars at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium . <p/>Jacksonville fell to 5-10 on its way to its first losing year since Coach Jack Del Rio 's initial season ( 5-11 ) in 2003 . <p/>The loss ended a sordid home campaign in which the Jaguars went 2-6 . <p/>The Colts ( 11-4 ) , on an eight-game winning streak , clinched a playoff berth . <p/>Tony Dungy became the first coach since the 1970 merger to take his team to the playoffs in 10 consecutive years . <p/>Garrard threw for a career-high 329 yards , but late in the fourth quarter he made costly mistakes . <p/>After scoring on four of their first five drives , including their first two , the Jaguars punted to start the fourth quarter . <p/>On their next drive , with 4:48 remaining in the game , Garrard threw an interception to defensive back Keiwan Ratliff , who returned the pick 35 yards for a touchdown . <p/>`` It was actually man-coverage , and he made a smart play by dropping off of Dennis [ Northcutt ] , '' Garrard said . <p/>`` You never see that in man coverage . <p/>They know we like the slant game on that down and distance and they watched tape . '' <p/>The score gave Indianapolis its first lead of the game . <p/>Garrard finished with 28 completions on 41 attempts , a touchdown and an interception . <p/>The Jaguars had one final chance to win the game , fielding a Colts punt with 2:34 remaining . <p/>But with 12 seconds left , Garrard dropped back to pass and found Colts defensive end Dwight Freeney on top of him , nine yards behind the line of scrimmage . <p/>The sack ended the game . <p/>`` I did n't even see it coming , '' Garrard said . <p/>`` So I could n't use my legs to make a play . '' <p/>For the second home game in a row , the Jaguars started aggressively . <p/>They won the coin toss , and then elected to receive , just like they did against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday . <p/>Then they scored immediately , just like they did on Sunday . <p/>On their second drive , the Jaguars scored again , jumping to a 14-0 lead with a 2-yard touchdown run by Garrard . <p/>Despite the Colts ' passing perfection , Indianapolis could n't score . <p/>`` This is a funny game , '' Manning said . <p/>`` We were completing some passes , but were down 14-0 . <p/>So that dominated our thoughts . '' <p/>In the second half , Manning really went to work . <p/>He threw two touchdown passes and set up a game-tying 45-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri . <p/>And any time the Colts needed something to happen , they went to their passing game . <p/>Running plays were unreliable . <p/>The Jaguars could stop those . <p/>The Colts gained just 32 yards rushing . <p/>But the passes baffled the Jaguars ' defense , sailing at the most important times to exactly where they needed to be . <p/>`` Peyton Manning is a good quarterback , '' Jaguars safety Reggie Nelson said . <p/>`` He has always been good . <p/>That 's what he does .

Williams , who represents the area of Flatbush , has been tweeting live updates , and said : \u2018 I \u2019 m in the middle of the riot action at Church and Snyder in my district . <p/>Right now , things are tense . <p/>Young people have expressed anger . \u2019 <p/>Mr Williams later described the scene of chaos in Flatbush , saying that garbage cans had been overturned and people smashed out windows . <p/>He added that one person had been attacked outside of a local Rite Aid . <p/>\u2018 Tonight was a peaceful vigil that devolved into a riot , \u2019 he wrote . <p/>\u2018 The youth in this community have no outlets for their anger , no community . \u2019 <p/>Another Twitter user who is apparently at the site said that the riot 'sounds like a war zone . ' <p/>A source told the New York Daily News that the protest began some 20 blocks from where Gray was fatally shot . <p/>The march went past the 67th Presinct station , where officers impeded the protest \u2019 s progress . <p/>That \u2019 s when the peaceful protest got out of hand . <p/>The unnamed NYPD officer told the Daily News that they saw teens jumping on cars and throwing bottles at officers . <p/>Gray , 16 , was shot eleven times after police said he pulled out a . 357 revolver in East Flatbush , Brooklyn over the weekend . <p/>Police say they came across a group of young men on Saturday evening and saw Gray acting suspiciously , walking away from his friends when he saw the officers approach . <p/>Officers say the 16 - year old began to adjust his waistband and started to act suspiciously . <p/>Gray then turned around and pointed a . 357 caliber gun at them , according to police accounts . <p/>When the two plainclothes officers saw the weapon they responded by opening fire . <p/>The teen was rushed to Kings County Hospital but he later died . <p/>However , witnesses to the shooting say that the NYPD's account is wrong . <p/>Gray \u2019 s older sister , Mahnefah Gray , 19 , told the New York Times that one of the witnesses of the shooting told her that her brother was only fixing his belt . <p/>She added that her brother had too much \u2018 common sense \u2019 to point a loaded gun at an officer , and doubted that he was even carrying a gun at all . <p/>A woman who lives across the street from the scene of the shooting told the Times that Gray was calling out : \u2018 Please don \u2019 t let me die ! \u2019 and said the officers yelled back : \u2018 Stay down , or we \u2019 ll shoot you again . \u2019 <p/>Grey lived in nearby Crown Heights , but had grown up in East Flatbush and returned there to visit friends . <p/>His older brother , Jamar , was killed in a car accident two years ago . <p/>According to witnesses , when the two cops arrived on the scene in an unmarked car , Gray was part of a group of six teenagers standing by the side of the road . <p/>One of Gray's friends , Devonte Brown told the New York Post : 'As the cops opened fire , he was screaming , \u2018 Stop ! <p/>I \u2019 m not running ! \u2019 <p/>His friends have not explained exactly what caused the police officers to shoot . <p/>Police say Gray's gun was loaded with four bullets but have not yet determined whether the teenager fired his weapon . <p/>Gray had been in trouble with the law before , having been arrested three times since October and had previously been charged with grand larceny and inciting a riot .",

'' <p/>The 1,000-member evangelical church was the subject of intense scrutiny after Ms. Palin was named Senator John McCain 's running mate . <p/>Early in her campaign , the church was criticized for promoting in a Sunday bulletin a Focus on the Family `` Love Won Out Conference '' in Anchorage . <p/>The conference promised to `` help men and women dissatisfied with living homosexually understand that same-sex attractions can be overcome .

James Clark said . <p/>\"She believed they were spraying chemicals at her , saying things behind her back , \" Clark said . <p/>After leaving the break room , Hiller went down a hallway and fired shots at the supervisor who had suspended her and at a mechanic who was using a walkie - talkie to alert police and co - workers to her whereabouts , police said . <p/>She missed both . <p/>Hiller finally went to a second - floor office and called police to tell them what she had done , authorities said . <p/>Seven other workers were hiding in a closet nearby . <p/>Cpl . Janice Leader , a 911 dispatcher , told reporters Friday that Hiller called 911 , saying \"I'm the one you're looking for\" and reporting that she had been harassed at work . <p/>Keeping her on the line , Leader said she told Hiller to put the gun down and place her hands on her head so officers wouldn't take any aggressive action against her . <p/>When tactical police who had entered the plant found her , Hiller was in a fetal position on the floor , the gun beside her . <p/>Police called the mechanic a hero who \"did a phenomenal job\" in alerting employees to evacuate the building and directing officers to where Hiller was . <p/>\"By following the suspect at great peril to himself \u2013 and we can see that by the fact that he was shot at and almost hit \u2013 he reduced our tactical problem quite dramatically , \" Chief Inspector Joe Sullivan said . <p/>Police identified the victims as Tanya Renee Wilson , 47 ; LaTonya Sharon Brown , 36 ; and Bryant A .

  "marked_doc": "http : / / articles . washingtonpost . com / 2009 - 03 - 04 / news / 36879035 _ 1 _ bridge - project - obama - administration - george - w - bush <p/>Obama Reverses Bush on Species <mark id=\"mark_id\"> Protection </mark> Measure <p/>March 04 , 2009 <p/>In a move that will subject a number of government projects to enhanced environmental and scientific scrutiny , President Obama is restoring a requirement that U . S . agencies consult with independent federal experts to determine whether their actions might harm threatened and endangered species . <p/>The presidential memorandum issued yesterday , which marks yet another reversal of former president George W . Bush's environmental legacy , will revive a decades - old practice under the Endangered Species Act that calls for agencies to consult with either the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on whether their projects could affect imperiled species . <p/>On Dec . 16 , the Bush administration allowed agencies to waive such reviews if they decided , on their own , that the actions would not harm vulnerable plants and animals . <p/>Obama , who visited the Interior Department to commemorate its 160th anniversary , said he had instructed Interior and Commerce Department officials to review the Bush rules . <p/>In the meantime , according to the memorandum , officials should \"follow the prior longstanding consultation and concurrence practices\" that call for independent reviews . <p/>\"The work of scientists and experts in my administration , including here at the Interior Department , will be respected , \" Obama said . <p/>\"With smart , sustainable policies , we can grow our economy today and preserve the environment . \" <p/>Environmentalists and scientists welcomed the move , but business officials said it could delay federally funded projects that could help revive the nation's economy : All of them agreed it would prompt a second look at several initiatives adopted by the Bush administration in its final months in office . <p/>Earthjustice lawyer Janette Brimmer , whose group had challenged the Bush rule in federal district court in California , said she expected that the new administration would reexamine two pending projects : a Bureau of Land Management plan for overseeing Oregon's forests , which was finalized on Dec . 30 and could affect protected species such as the northern spotted owl ; and construction of the White Pine coal - fired power plant in Nevada . <p/>\"I think the Obama administration now is going to take a step back on these projects . <p/>It needs to bring science back into the equation , \" Brimmer said , adding that her group will not drop its lawsuit until it can assess how the new policy is working . <p/>Francesca Grifo of the Union of Concerned Scientists , an activist group , said the switch would help guard against the potential conflicts of interest and lack of expertise that could color decision - making by any agency hoping to press ahead with a particular project . <p/>\"After years of scientific scandal , the Interior Department and its partner agencies need desperately to regain credibility by making decisions with honesty , clarity and transparency , \" Grifo said . <p/>But William L . Kovacs , the U . S . Chamber of Commerce's vice president of environment , technology and regulatory affairs , said that reviving another layer of review \"will result in even greater delays to projects - - including stimulus - backed , job - creating projects - - as agencies now grapple with the prospect of lengthy interagency consultations to determine , for instance , if a bridge project in Florida contributes to the melting of Arctic ice . <p/>This is such a departure from the spirit and the letter of the Endangered Species Act that we wonder if the law's drafters would even recognize it today . \" <p/>The latest policy shift follows several other administration actions revamping environmental policies , including a reexamination of fuel economy standards and offshore oil drilling ; a new review of whether to grant California and other states the right to regulate greenhouse - gas emissions from vehicles ; and the endorsement of a new international treaty negotiation on global mercury emissions . <p/>House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick J . Rahall II ( D - W . Va . ) , who had been seeking to overturn Bush's endangered species rule through legislation , called the announcement \"one more indication that the new administration truly represents change for the better and is committed to the protection of our natural resources and our environment . \" <p/>Officials said the move is unlikely to trigger broad use of the Endangered Species Act to regulate greenhouse - gas emissions . <p/>While the Bush rule specifically prohibited endangered species consultations on the basis of \"global processes\" such as climate change , an Interior official speaking on the condition of anonymity said that under the new policy , such a review would be triggered only if scientific evidence suggested \"a causal connection\" between emissions from a federal project and its effect on an imperiled species or an identifiable part of its habitat .",

VA089897 filed this morning by Deputy District Attorney Lowell Anger of CAPOS . <p/>Although filed as a capital case , the District Attorney \u2019 s office will decide closer to trial whether to seek the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole . <p/>Orozco is charged with one count of murder of a peace officer with the special circumstances of murder of a peace officer during performance of his duties , lying in wait and murder to avoid arrest . <p/>It was alleged the defendant personally used a handgun to commit the crime . <p/>The complaint also alleged two counts of possession of a firearm by a felon for the June 24 murder of Ortiz and on June 20 , when a man was shot and wounded in Hawaiian Gardens . <p/>It was that shooting that Deputy Ortiz was investigating when he was killed . <p/>Deputy Ortiz was shot to death outside an apartment in the 12000 block of East 223rd Street . <p/>The deputy was with the Sheriff \u2019 s gang enforcement unit and was investigating the June 20 shooting . <p/>Authorities said he spotted Orozco shortly after 3 p . m . and chased him to the apartment . <p/>The killer was hiding behind the apartment \u2019 s front door . <p/>The defendant was arrested five buildings away on 223rd Street shortly before midnight . <p/>A . 38 - caliber revolver believed to be the murder weapon was recovered . <p/>Orozco also was charged with one count of attempted willful , deliberate , premeditated murder in connection with the June 20 shooting . <p/>The victim was shot while doing yard work at a home in the 22000 block of Joliet Avenue . <p/>He was hit in the back , but survived . <p/>The complaint charged that the June 20 shooting was for furtherance of a street gang . <p/>The complaint also alleged prior convictions including auto burglary , possession of a firearm by a felon and resisting and executive officer . <p/>Orozco will be held without bail . <p/>Joining Cooley at the news conference was Assistant Sheriff Doyle Campbell .",

  "marked_doc": "http : / / sports . yahoo . com / news / colts - beat - chiefs - 20 - 13 - 212218446 - - nfl . html <p/>Colts beat Chiefs 20 - 13 to clinch playoff berth <p/>December 23 , 2012 6 : 11 PM <p/>The expectations placed upon Andrew Luck almost seemed unfair . <p/>Being the heir to Peyton Manning in Indianapolis is heady stuff for a rookie taking the reins of a franchise that won two games last season . <p/>Now , after guiding the Colts back to the playoffs - and breaking Cam Newton's single - season passing <mark id=\"mark_id\"> record </mark> for a first - year player - it's safe to say Luck exceeded just about all of them . <p/>Luck threw for 205 yards Sunday , and his 7 - yard touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne on third - and - goal late in the fourth quarter gave the Colts a 20 - 13 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs . <p/>That put them into the playoffs without worrying about anybody else . <p/>''Would we have done it without him ? '' Colts interim coach Bruce Arians asked . <p/>''No . '' <p/>Luck broke Newton's record of 4 , 051 yards passing in the second quarter . <p/>But it was extending his own rookie record for fourth - quarter comebacks to seven was more important . <p/>The Chiefs had rallied behind Jamaal Charles' 226 yards rushing to tie the game 13 - 13 heading into the fourth quarter . <p/>The Colts' defense stuffed quarterback Brady Quinn on fourth - and - inches to give Luck a chance . <p/>That's all he needed . <p/>After a miserable stretch in which he connected on 1 of 13 passes , the fabulous freshman calmly led Indianapolis ( 10 - 5 ) downfield . <p/>He completed a key pass to T . Y . Hilton on third down and made two nice throws to Wayne before hitting the veteran in the back of the end zone . <p/>''We had so many opportunities all game , especially on third down , that we squandered , '' Wayne said . <p/>''We wanted to get that done . <p/>That was the opportune time to do it . '' <p/>Darius Butler returned an interception 32 yards for the Colts' other touchdown , helping them join the 2008 Miami Dolphins as the only teams to win at least 10 games after losing 14 or more the previous season . <p/>Most of those wins have come under Arians , who has filled in admirably while Chuck Pagano underwent treatment for leukemia . <p/>Pagano is expected to rejoin the Colts this week . <p/>''Mission accomplished . <p/>That's all I can say , '' Arians said . <p/>''Without getting emotional again , knowing that ( Pagano ) is going to be back Monday , the work week shouldn't be as stressful . '' <p/>Charles' big day included an 86 - yard touchdown run on the first play of the second half . <p/>It was his second 200 - yard game of the season , and came one week after he managed 10 yards on nine carries against Oakland . <p/>''It was fun today , competing out there and doing it while we were trying to come back , '' Charles said . <p/>''It was fun going out there and putting out a performance like that . '' <p/>Charles joined the Titans' Chris Johnson and former Lions great Barry Sanders as the only players with three runs of 80 or more yards in a season . <p/>His third career 200 - yard game also set a franchise record , which he had shared with Larry Johnson . <p/>Peyton Hillis added 101 yards on the ground for the Chiefs ( 2 - 13 ) , who had 352 yards rushing in a losing effort - the first time that's happened in NFL history . <p/>A big reason why was Quinn , who was just 10 of 22 for 162 yards with two interceptions . <p/>''This game was without a doubt , 100 percent on my shoulders , '' he said . <p/>''You can't play the way I played today and win a football game . '' <p/>His trouble began with the Chiefs' fifth offensive play , when he threw woefully behind Dexter McCluster - who wasn't even looking for the ball . <p/>Butler picked off the pass in stride , taking it untouched to the end zone for a 7 - 0 lead . <p/>Kansas City managed a field goal by Ryan Succop , but he missed his next try and the Colts went the other direction to set up the first of Adam Vinatieri's two field goals . <p/>Charles fumbled in the red zone later in the second quarter , and the Colts moved into Vinatieri's range for a 36 - yard field goal and a 13 - 3 halftime lead . <p/>Charles electrified a sparse crowd on the first play of the second half . <p/>He angled to the left and then found room down the sideline , cutting back toward the middle of the field and winning a foot - race with the Indianapolis defense for an 86 - yard touchdown run . <p/>The Chiefs were in position to take the lead later in the third quarter , but Quinn was picked off by Vontae Davis in the end zone . <p/>The defense forced a three - and - out and Kansas City was driving again before settling for Succop's tying 47 - yard field goal . <p/>The Chiefs got the ball back again late in the fourth quarter , but Quinn was stuffed on a quarterback sneak on fourth - and - inches from the Indianapolis 27 . <p/>That turned the ball over to Luck , who completed an 11 - yard pass to T . Y . Hilton to convert a third down before he and Wayne won it . <p/>''At times it looked a little bleak , '' Arians said . <p/>''Guys hung in there , made plays when they had to make them . <p/>Offensively we struggled , and then put together a drive , like we have all year . '' <p/>Notes : Chiefs WR Terrance Copper ( left knee ) and DT Tyson Jackson ( left foot ) left with injuries . . . . <p/>Wayne had five catches to become the fifth player in NFL history with four 100 - catch seasons . <p/>He also became the 14th player to reach 13 , 000 yards receiving .",

  "marked_doc": "Critical IE patch now available : go get it ! <p/>In Thursday 's IT Blogwatch , Richi Jennings watches bloggers watch Microsoft 's latest out-of-cycle , critical patch for Internet Explorer . <p/>Not to mention portability , 1980 's style ... <p/>As it promised [ Tuesday ] , Microsoft Corp. today issued an <mark id=\"mark_id\"> emergency </mark> patch to plug a critical hole in Internet Explorer ( IE ) that attackers have been increasingly exploiting from hacked Web sites . <p/>The patch , described in Microsoft 's security bulletin MS08-078 , fixes a flaw in the data-binding function of all available versions of the popular browser , including IE5.01 , IE6 , IE7 and IE8 Beta 2 . <p/>Microsoft labeled the bug as `` critical , '' the most serious threat ranking in its four-step scoring system . <p/>According to both Microsoft and numerous security firms , attacks have been mounting , particularly since last weekend , when hackers began hijacking legitimate Web sites and launching exploits against unwary visitors . <p/>In fact , Microsoft said it monitored a `` huge increase '' in attacks last Saturday . <p/>The number of infected Web sites , many of them legitimate , has grown at `` an alarming '' rate since the vulnerability was released into the wild and people need to do nothing but visit an infected site with a vulnerable browser to be affected . <p/>By Friday , Microsoft was aware users were becoming infected at a rate even faster than previous zero-day exploits . <p/>Originally porn sites seemed to be the carriers , but the number of legit sites causing infections was skyrocketing . <p/>Hackers were planting the exploit using well-known SQL injection techniques . <p/>It is users ' turn to protect themselves by installing this emergency patch and all all the others , and fast . <p/>Since the bad guys were exploiting it before Microsoft knew it existed , the exploit is termed `` zero day '' because that is how much notice Microsoft got of the problem . <p/>It is also termed an `` drive-by '' exploit since a user could pick up a malware infestation by merely using IE to browse any of thousands of compromised websites . <p/>In short , it was really nasty stuff . <p/>Brian Krebs sounds worried: <p/>Microsoft estimated Monday that one in every 500 Windows users had been exposed to sites that try to exploit the flaw . <p/>Additionally , it said the number of victims was increasing at a rate of 50 percent daily . <p/>This is an urgent update . <p/>If you use Windows , apply this patch now . <p/>Microsoft 's Mike Reavey grabs the mic: <p/>This update will be applied automatically to hundreds of millions of customers through automatic updates over the next few days . <p/>And , for our enterprise customers - with multiple systems within their networks - this update can be deployed through all standard security update management systems including , SCCM , SMS , WSUS , and Windows Update <p/>This update meets the quality , deployment and application compatibility criteria . <p/>It is a high-quality update , ready for broad release , and we encourage customers to test and deploy this update as quickly as possible . <p/>We were able to share detailed information with our partners in the Microsoft Active Protections Program ( MAPP ) and Microsoft Security Response Alliance ( MSRA ) , allowing protections to be created for over 24 different security partners ' products . <p/>This is further validation of our commitment to 'community based defense ' and means customers that ... were n't even using Microsoft products , were also protected from known attacks . <p/>Ed Oswald is impressed by Microsoft 's speed: <p/>Well , that was quick . <p/>It 's pretty bad when security experts are telling your customers to switch . <p/>These are unbiased ( for the most part ) folks , and the typical computer user is going to take their advice seriously . <p/>But Tiny Dancer ... well , not so much: <p/>Eight days is rather shamefully long to have to wait for a potentially devastating vulnerability to be fixed . <p/>This ai n't Hanukkah , Microsoft , and you ai n't no Maccabee .",

Horton fall down . <p/>I honestly thought she was shot in the head . <p/>There was blood . \" <p/>Armstead also testified that she heard a group of young men arguing about a gun shortly before the shooting , which matches up with prosecutors' claim that Carrasquillo ordered Lopez to the roof with the gun after a dispute between their 8 Block gang and the rival Young Guns crew . <p/>The talk of guns had made Armstead nervous , especially since she was with her young son . <p/>\"I speed - walked to my son , and I held him . <p/>I was scared . <p/>I was trying to get out of harm's way , \" she testified . <p/>Armstead said she sought safety for herself and her son in a store , but when activity on the street seemed to have settled , she walked back outside - where a bullet went straight through her arm and she saw Horton killed . <p/>Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Vincent Del Giudice briefly sealed the courtroom at the request of prosecutors because their next witness had been threatened with death by the alleged shooter's brother . <p/>The fearful witness had entered the courtroom with hood over his head , Del Giudice said when the courtroom was reopened . <p/>\"The man is an emotional wreck , \" the judge said before postponing the man's testimony until Monday .",

Y . Hilton on third down and made two nice throws to Wayne before hitting the veteran in the back of the end zone . <p/>\"We had so many opportunities all game , especially on third down , that we squandered , \" Wayne said . <p/>\"We wanted to get that done . <p/>That was the opportune time to do it . \" <p/>Darius Butler returned an interception 32 yards for the Colts' other touchdown , helping them join the 2008 Miami Dolphins as the only teams to win at least 10 games after losing 14 or more the previous season . <p/>Most of those wins have come under Arians , who has filled in admirably while Chuck Pagano underwent treatment for leukemia . <p/>Pagano is expected to rejoin the Colts this week . <p/>\"Mission accomplished . <p/>That's all I can say , \" Arians said . <p/>\"Without getting emotional again , knowing that ( Pagano ) is going to be back Monday , the work week shouldn't be as stressful . \" <p/>Charles' big day included an 86 - yard touchdown run on the first play of the second half . <p/>It was his second 200 - yard game of the season , and came one week after he managed 10 yards on nine carries against Oakland . <p/>\"It was fun today , competing out there and doing it while we were trying to come back , \" Charles said . <p/>\"It was fun going out there and putting out a performance like that . \" <p/>Charles joined the Titans' Chris Johnson and former Lions great Barry Sanders as the only players with three runs of 80 or more yards in a season . <p/>His third career 200 - yard game also set a franchise record , which he had shared with Larry Johnson . <p/>Peyton Hillis added 101 yards on the ground for the Chiefs ( 2 - 13 ) , who had 352 yards rushing in a losing effort \u2013 the first time that's happened in NFL history . <p/>A big reason why was Quinn , who was just 10 of 22 for 162 yards with two interceptions . <p/>\"This game was without a doubt , 100 percent on my shoulders , \" he said . <p/>\"You can't play the way I played today and win a football game . \" <p/>His trouble began with the Chiefs' fifth offensive play , when he threw woefully behind Dexter McCluster \u2013 who wasn't even looking for the ball . <p/>Butler picked off the pass in stride , taking it untouched to the end zone for a 7 - 0 lead . <p/>Kansas City managed a field goal by Ryan Succop , but he missed his next try and the Colts went the other direction to set up the first of Adam Vinatieri's two field goals . <p/>Charles fumbled in the red zone later in the second quarter , and the Colts moved into Vinatieri's range for a 36 - yard field goal and a 13 - 3 halftime lead . <p/>Charles electrified a sparse crowd on the first play of the second half . <p/>He angled to the left and then found room down the sideline , cutting back toward the middle of the field and winning a foot - race with the Indianapolis defense for an 86 - yard touchdown run . <p/>The Chiefs were in position to take the lead later in the third quarter , but Quinn was picked off by Vontae Davis in the end zone . <p/>The defense forced a three - and - out and Kansas City was driving again before settling for Succop's tying 47 - yard field goal . <p/>The Chiefs got the ball back again late in the fourth quarter , but Quinn was stuffed on a quarterback sneak on fourth - and - inches from the Indianapolis 27 . <p/>That turned the ball over to Luck , who completed an 11 - yard pass to T . Y . Hilton to convert a third down before he and Wayne won it . <p/>\"At times it looked a little bleak , \" Arians said . <p/>\"Guys hung in there , made plays when they had to make them . <p/>Offensively we struggled , and then put together a drive , like we have all year . \" <p/>Notes : Chiefs WR Terrance Copper ( left knee ) and DT Tyson Jackson ( left foot ) left with injuries . . . . <p/>Wayne had five catches to become the fifth player in NFL history with four 100 - catch seasons . <p/>He also became the 14th player to reach 13 , 000 yards receiving .",
