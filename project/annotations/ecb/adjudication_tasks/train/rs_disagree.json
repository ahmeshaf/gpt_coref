Henry . <p/>Though the newspaper doesn't cite its source , it stated that the offer is \"believed to be for at least eight years . \" <p/>The Red Sox have a club policy of not commenting on their negotiating stance with any free agents . <p/>Last week at the Winter Meetings , the Washington Nationals made Teixeira an eight - year , $160 million offer . <p/>Angels general manager Tony Reagins recently confirmed that his club had also made an eight - year offer . <p/>The Orioles , according to reports , have offered Teixeira a seven - year deal worth between $140 million and $150 million . <p/>As for the Red Sox , GM Theo Epstein hasn't so much as uttered Teixeira's name in any interviews with media members this offseason . <p/>That has always been the way Epstein conducts his business , and it's why you won't hear any public comments from the Red Sox regarding Teixeira until he either signs with Boston or goes somewhere else . <p/>\"We're being aggressive , really aggressive on players that we like , \" Epstein said last week . <p/>The two biggest investments the Red Sox have made under current ownership ? <p/>A $103 . 1 million sum - - including the $51 . 1 million posting fee - - to Daisuke Matsuzaka over six seasons and a five - year , $70 million contract for J . D . Drew . <p/>Though breaking the bank in free agency isn't typically the way the Red Sox go about their Hot Stove business , they feel that Teixeira - - who will turn 29 in April - - could be the centerpiece of their lineup for the better part of a decade . <p/>The switch - hitter does everything the Red Sox like , from getting on base to hitting for power to playing terrific defense at first base . <p/>Epstein was asked at the Winter Meetings if the Red Sox could sign a marquee free agent this winter . <p/>\"I think there's a chance of it , \" he said . <p/>\"There's definitely a chance that we don't . <p/>I can't tell you which [ answer ] , eight , 10 , 12 years from now would have been better for the organization . <p/>But players that we like and think can help us , we're going to try to sign to numbers that we think are reasonable and help us going forward and help us with our foundation . <p/>If we get them , great . <p/>If we don't , then we'll move on . \" <p/>The Yankees , Boston's top rival , have already made a loud statement this winter , agreeing to terms with starters CC Sabathia and A . J . Burnett . <p/>Though Epstein never likes to act as if he is counteracting the Yankees , Teixeira would clearly give Boston's lineup a more dynamic look . <p/>There have been conflicting reports as to whether the Yankees have interest in Teixeira . <p/>When Boras spoke at the Winter Meetings , he didn't sound as if he was in any rush to close the Teixeira deal . <p/>Back in November , while attending a Georgia Tech football game , Teixeira told ESPN that he'd like to sign by Christmas . <p/>If the Red Sox are successful in landing Teixeira , it will create a somewhat sticky situation . <p/>The Red Sox have Kevin Youkilis at first base and Mike Lowell at third . <p/>To open a spot for Teixeira , the Red Sox might have to trade Lowell and move Youkilis across the diamond . <p/>However , Lowell , coming off right hip surgery , is likely to have to prove his health in Spring Training if he is to be dealt . <p/>Last winter the Red Sox re - signed Lowell , the Most Valuable Player of the 2007 World Series , to a three - year , $37 . 5 million contract . <p/>The Red Sox control Youkilis contractually for the next two years , so it's highly doubtful he would be moved . <p/>Youkilis finished third in the American League Most Valuable Player voting in November . <p/>David Ortiz , Boston's star designated hitter , is a 10 - 5 man ( 10 years in the Majors , five with the same team ) , meaning he could veto any trade .",

  "marked_doc": "Turkmenistan voted Sunday in a parliamentary election meant to show that the energy-rich central Asian nation was shedding its autocratic <mark id=\"mark_id\"> past </mark> , but Western observers said nothing had changed . <p/>Authorities said turnout reached 93.87 percent in the election for 288 candidates , all of whom support the policies of President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov in the ex-Soviet republic . <p/>Voting stations were festooned with Turkmen flags and pictures of Berdymukhamedov , the successor of eccentric dictator Saparmurat Niyazov , who ruled Turkmenistan for two decades until his death in 2006 . <p/>Over 2.5 million people were eligible to vote in the election , held under the framework of a new constitution approved in September and intended to increase parliament 's powers and raise the number of seats from 65 to 125 . <p/>`` I attach hopes for the better to these elections , especially for our children , '' Valentina Redzhepova , an official at one of Ashgabat 's voting precincts , told AFP . <p/>`` We are waiting for borders to open even further so more guests can come to us and so we can visit them . '' <p/>Voters , however , appeared reluctant to criticise the government . <p/>In Gyami , a village outside the Turkmen capital , 25-year-old Guzel said she had come to the local polling station to vote and watch her daughter perform in a children 's folk-dance troupe . <p/>`` I voted for our fellow village resident . <p/>He is an experienced person and knows village life well , '' she said . <p/>Pensioner Bayram-aga , a voter in Ashgabat , said: <p/>`` I remember the elections from the Soviet days. ... <p/>People were very active then , it was like a festival . <p/>Now it 's much quieter . '' <p/>Western observers say Niyazov still casts a shadow , despite promises of openness by Berdymukhamedov and some moves to dismantle the late dictator 's bizarre personality cult . <p/>Niyazov 's gold statue still towers over the desert nation 's capital , rotating to face the sun . <p/>`` The facade has changed but the foundations remain the same , '' said a Western diplomat , who requested anonymity . <p/>`` Power rests entirely with the president . <p/>His photo appears every day on the front of the papers . <p/>He strictly controls the economy and the whole of the media , '' the diplomat added . <p/>New York-based Human Rights Watch said in an assessment last month that Turkmenistan had made `` some progress '' but `` remains ... one of the most repressive and authoritarian states in the world . '' <p/>The elections are unlikely to get a clean bill of health from the West , not least as all candidates have stressed support for the president while campaigning . <p/>The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe sent eight experts to monitor the poll and draw up an `` internal report . '' <p/>The group 's spokesman , Jens Hagen Eschenbecher , told AFP that the experts would not be making any public statements on their conclusions . <p/>Ninety percent of the 288 candidates come from the Democratic Party set up by Niyazov in place of the Communist Party , with the other 10 percent coming from so-called `` initiative groups '' that have little clout . <p/>All candidates are funded by the state , with a ban on other funding . <p/>Western journalists have been refused permission to cover the vote . <p/>Foreign election observers will mainly come from the Commonwealth of Independent States , a post-Soviet group with little credibility . <p/>With its enormous natural gas reserves , Turkmenistan is central to European efforts to diversify gas supplies away from Russia . <p/>Berdymukhamedov has voiced support for giving the West more access to Turkmen gas .",

  "marked_doc": "Voters in reclusive Turkmenistan elect a parliament Sunday in balloting heralded by authorities in the natural gas-rich nation as a key step toward democratic standards but <mark id=\"mark_id\"> dismissed </mark> by critics as a sham . <p/>The election comes two years after the death of idiosyncratic dictator Saparmurat Niyazov , which kindled hopes here and in the West that the Central Asian country would gradually roll back its oppressive political regime and introduce greater freedoms . <p/>Niyazov 's successor , President Gurbanguli Berdymukhamedov , has revoked some of his more draconian decrees and vowed to pursue political reform . <p/>But most of the parliamentary candidates are from the only permitted political party , and exiled opposition activists say the president has failed to live up to his promises . <p/>`` Beyond all the pompous declarations , there will be no real change , '' Tadzhigul Begmedova , director of the Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights , said by telephone from Varna , Bulgaria . <p/>`` The hopes many people had that a new president would open up Turkmen society have been shattered . '' <p/>On the surface , Turkmenistan 's political landscape is changing . <p/>In September , the rubber-stamp People 's Council - a 2,507-member assembly of presidential appointees , town elders and others - voted to abolish itself and cede most of its powers to an expanded parliament . <p/>But out of the 288 candidates running for the 125 seats Sunday , more than half are members of the pro-presidential Democratic Party of Turkmenistan - a political force created out of the ashes of the Soviet-era Turkmen Communist Party . <p/>Non-party candidates have been drawn from state-controlled women 's and veterans ' organizations , trade unions and a youth group . <p/>The only non-party candidate in the capital , Ashgabat , avidly supports Berdymukhamedov - undermining official claims the polls will offer a wide choice . <p/>`` I will devote all my strengths to the honest and righteous support of our esteemed president 's domestic and foreign policy , '' the candidate , regional bureaucrat Resulberdy Mammedov , said in a campaign statement . <p/>Niyazov isolated Turkmenistan from the international community and forged a pervasive personality cult . <p/>He called himself Turkmenbashi , or father of all Turkmens , renamed months after himself and his mother , and made his self-penned spiritual tome mandatory reading for students and state employees . <p/>With Berdymukhamedov decreasing the country 's isolation , government opponents claim the election is aimed to appease Western countries that are eager to win access to its vast natural-gas reserves but wary of its record on democracy and human rights . <p/>The U.S. and European Union are seeking to lessen Russia 's control over exports of Turkmen gas . <p/>`` This whole spectacle has been arranged for the international community , to show that Turkmenistan is following the path of democratization , '' said Begmedova . <p/>While officials have extolled the vote as an exercise in democracy , there has been little campaigning and little coverage on state-run television , in contrast with the February 2007 presidential election that confirmed Berdymukhamedov 's role as head of state . <p/>`` There are very few billboards around the city . <p/>With just four days to go before the election , I still do n't know who I 'm supposed to vote for , '' said Maral , 45 , an Ashgabat resident who declined to give her surname for fear of official intimidation .",

  "marked_doc": "Turkmenistan 's voters <mark id=\"mark_id\"> are going to the polls </mark> in parliamentary elections portrayed by the government as a step towards democracy in the gas-rich Central Asian nation . <p/>But critics say that Sunday 's vote is a sham with all the candidates either representing the ruling Democratic Party , the only registered party , or a handful of state-approved independents . <p/>`` Beyond all the pompous declarations , there will be no real change , '' Tadzhigul Begmedova , director of the Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights , said from Bulgaria . <p/>`` The hopes many people had that a new president would open up Turkmen society have been shattered . '' <p/>Gurbanguli Berdymukhamedov became president in 2006 after the death of Saparmurat Niyazov , who forged a personality cult that saw months of the year renamed after himself and his mother , and a spiritual guide he authored become mandatory for students and government workers . <p/>'Pluralism and openess ' <p/>Berdymukhamedov rolled back some of the decrees which had celebrated the previous leader and vowed to increase democracy and foreign investment . <p/>`` It does not matter who gets elected . <p/>The president has the final say `` <p/>`` This campaign stands out for its pluralism , openness and the activeness of the citizens , '' an election official told the AFP news agency , requesting anonymity . <p/>In September , the People 's Council , a 2,507-member assembly of presidential appointees , town elders and others , voted to abolish itself and cede most of its powers to an expanded parliament . <p/>But more than half of the 288 candidates running for the parliament 's 125 seats on Sunday are from the Democratic Party , while the others have been drawn from state-controlled women 's and veterans ' organisations , trade unions and a youth group . <p/>All of them receive state funding for the campaign as no other form of political funding is allowed under Turkmenistan 's laws . <p/>`` It does not matter who gets elected . <p/>The president has the final say , '' Osman-aga , who herds camels in a remote desert area , told the Reuters news agency . <p/>Contest 'impossible ' <p/>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe has not sent only three observers to monitor the vote , saying a genuine contest was impossible . <p/>Human Rights Watch said in a report last month: <p/>`` The conditions are not in place to hold a free and fair election that would be a meaningful reflection of the will of the people . '' <p/>The presence of foreign media also is limited as many journalists were unable to get permission to report there . <p/>The run-up to the election in the former Soviet state has seen little campaigning and garnered little coverage on state-run television . <p/>`` There are very few billboards around the city ... <p/>I still do n't know who I 'm supposed to vote for , '' Maral , a resident of Ashgabat who declined to give her surname for fear of official intimidation , told the Associated Press news agency .",

week trial in which he was convicted of the 2005 murder of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Jerry Ortiz . <p/>A rare exception for the 29 - year - old Hawaiian Gardens gang member was an occasional smile for his mother when he turned in his chair to glance back at her from time to time . <p/>He will be sentenced May 3 . <p/>When the jury convicted him last month of the deputy's slaying , as well as the attempted murder of another man just a few days prior to the ambush killing of Ortiz , Orozco sat staring straight ahead , unflinching . <p/>As Court Clerk Dan Fallon read the jury's sentence shortly before noon Tuesday , several members of the slain lawman's family gasped , clutching one another's hands . <p/>At the same time , a small smile spread across Orozco's face and he chuckled . <p/>\"We understand and we appreciate the gravity of the decision that the jury had to make . . . , and that it took a lot for them to ( come to that decision ) , \" Chela Ortiz , the deputy's wife , said afterward . <p/>\"We appreciate everything they did , we know they were very careful . . . and gave this a lot of their attention . \" <p/>Chela Ortiz - who was married three weeks before her husband was murdered - sat with her mother in - law , Rosa Ortiz , and the rest of the family every day of the trial . <p/>They were accompanied by dozens of sheriff's deputies and other family friends , including the family's priest . <p/>Most days were difficult and filled with tears as they listened to chilling testimony recounting the last few minutes of Ortiz's life and saw , for the first time , the crime scene and autopsy photos . <p/>\"I think , for all of us , it was kind of reliving the nightmare all over , \" Chela Ortiz said . <p/>Family members listened to testimony that included the defendant's violent past and the many times he escaped prosecution by using his gang's influence and power to intimidate victims - including two nearly killed when they were shot and stabbed in the back by Orozco , according to prosecutors . <p/>Orozco's friends and fellow gang members also recalled his boasting about killing a cop one day . <p/>\"I just say thank God it is over , \" the deputy's mother , Rosa Ortiz , said . <p/>\"It was too much some days . . . <p/>to me it was too hard . \" <p/>It took the jury of six men and six women a little more than four hours , spread over two days , to choose death over life in prison without the possibility of parole . <p/>It was almost the same amount of time used to come to the guilty verdict on March 20 . <p/>According to three jurors who spoke briefly outside the courtroom , the decision was a difficult one made slightly easier by the thorough job of the prosecutors and investigators . <p/>None of them wanted to be identified because of the gang ties to the case . <p/>The physical evidence , which including Orozco's DNA and fingerprints found on the murder weapon , was overwhelming , they said . <p/>There were also a number of eye witnesses including two girls who described for the jury how Orozco hid behind their front door and shot the deputy as Ortiz spoke with their mother . <p/>Equally as damning , jurors said , was the complete lack of remorse shown by the defendant . <p/>He squandered two opportunities to turn his life around , including chances to relocate out of state and away from the gang with his family in Las Vegas and again with a friend and former gang member in Florida , they said . <p/>It looked to them as though he preferred the life of a criminal and reveled in the notoriety he earned in the deputy's death . <p/>A taped conversation between Orozco and two friends - one a fellow gang member and the other an associate - in a holding cell at the Bellflower Courthouse made it clear to the jury that a life in prison would not diminish his threat to society , they said . <p/>In that tape , Orozco is heard talking about destroying evidence and ordering a hit on the two little girls and their mother - the star witnesses in the case . <p/>\"I had to hear that tape again , \" one juror said . <p/>\"Because if we were going to send him to jail for life , he could run the same business from behind bars , \" a second juror added . <p/>\"This way he can't harm anyone anymore . \" <p/>Apartment murder <p/>Ortiz was assigned to track Orozco down the day before his June 24 , 2005 murder . <p/>That task stemmed from the June 20 , 2005 shooting of a black man who - according to prosecutors - Orozco tried to kill simply because of his race . <p/>The 15 - year veteran , who learned the day before that he had made the rank of detective , was patrolling in Hawaiian Gardens near 223rd Street when he spotted Orozco and tried to stop him . <p/>The gang member took off running with Ortiz behind him , according to court testimony . <p/>Ortiz followed Orozco to an apartment complex in the 12500 block of East 223rd Street , to the home of one of Orozco's friends whom the deputy knew from previous altercations , at about 3 : 30 p . m . <p/>What Ortiz didn't know was that Orozco was lurking behind the woman's front door . <p/>As Ortiz spoke to her and reholstered his weapon , Orozco steadied his hand while two of the woman's children - girls age 6 and 8 - and several of her friends looked on . <p/>He fired just one shot from his . 38 - caliber revolver , with the slug passing through a crack in the door and hitting the deputy in the side of the head . <p/>The 35 - year - old newlywed and father to two boys died almost immediately . <p/>Tactical decision <p/>Stan Perlo , one of two court - appointed defense attorneys assigned to Orozco , said the defendant's lack of support from his family dealt a massive blow to their case . <p/>Originally , Orozco's mother was to take the stand to tell her son's story and talk about the many problems he faced growing up , Perlo said . <p/>But she became nervous , telling her son the night before she was to testify that she did not want to go through with it , Perlo explained . <p/>Orozco agreed not to force his mother to have to take the witness stand , a decision that likely destroyed his chance at any mercy on the part of the jury , he said . <p/>\"Our problem was we had no one to tell his story , \" Perlo said . <p/>\"We were counting on his mom and . . . she was too nervous to testify . \" <p/>Perlo and co - counsel Robin Yanes approached Orozco's case from a somewhat unorthodox position . <p/>Rather than argue their client's innocence , they repeatedly referred to their client as the gunman in the presence of the jury and focused on a number of other people they claimed were equally responsible in the crime . <p/>It was a tactical decision reached by the two veteran attorneys , both with extensive experience with death penalty cases , and after consultation with their peers , Perlo explained . <p/>\"We made a lot of decisions that some lawyers would disagree with , \" he said . <p/>\"I would add , personally , a lot of lawyers with a lot less experience . \" <p/>Long process <p/>When Orozco returns to court on May 3 , Perlo and Yanes will argue for a mistrial and , if that is rejected , will ask Judge Philip Hickok to modify the jury's verdict and consider life without parole . <p/>The chance either argument will be successful is slight , Perlo said . <p/>But that then sets into motion the automatic appeals process , something that will be handled by a different set of attorneys . <p/>During that time , Orozco will not be housed with the general population , he will have a cell all his own giving him isolation from much of the gang violence in the state's prisons . <p/>At the very least , Perlo estimated the appeals process will last five years . <p/>It could run into 20 years because there are both state and federal requirements that must be met , he added . <p/>A large part of the problem stems from finding lawyers who are available for such a lengthy commitment of time , who are willing to take on a stressful job and who are qualified , Perlo said . <p/>\"The decision today made the family happy , but unfortunately it's a false happiness , \" Perlo said after court Tuesday . <p/>\"I've dealt with issues of death for many years . . . <p/>the death penalty rarely offers . . . closure . \" <p/>The Ortiz family , however , disagreed . <p/>\"I'm kind of relieved that it's over , \" said 17 - year - old Jeremy Ortiz , one of the deputy's sons from a previous marriage . <p/>\"I'm happy with the verdict , we just have to wait it out now . \" <p/>Prior to the reading of the verdict , the deputy's family and friends waited in a courtroom filled to capacity but so quiet one could could hear the slight squeaks of the attorneys' leather chairs . <p/>Some bowed their heads and rubbed their faces , while others clasped their hands as though in prayer . <p/>When the sentence was finally announced a collective gasp for air was followed by cries and sobs as relatives sitting behind the family leaned forward to rub their shoulders and give a comforting squeeze . <p/>Outside the courtroom , Rosa Ortiz took out a button with a laminated picture of her slain son in uniform and handed it to the eldest of her five children , Art Ortiz , so that he could pin it on her blouse . <p/>Once it was secure she kissed it tenderly . <p/>For many minutes afterward , relatives and friends stood outside the courtroom hugging and crying . <p/>Detective Dawn Retzlaff , one of the two lead homicide detectives on the case , said authorities were grateful for the jury's thorough and careful review of the facts and investigators were happy with the verdict , calling it just . <p/>Speaking on behalf of the Sheriff's Department , Retzlaff added that they wanted to express their condolences to Ortiz's family in what was a devastating time . <p/>\"It's not a happy day for anybody , \" said Deputy District Attorney Lowell Anger , who prosecuted the case along with fellow DA Phillip Stirling . <p/>Anger said that the message sent by the jury's sentence - that killing a police officer and flaunting all respect for authority and for life will not be tolerated - was clear . <p/>It was the constant support from Anger , Stirling and the District Attorney's office , from the Sheriff's Department and other law enforcement agencies , and from the family's large circle of friends that made the tumultuous trial more bearable , Chela and her in - laws insisted . <p/>\"We could never repay them for all the support and love they have for this family , and that they have for Jerry , \" Chela said .",

Montgomery , an attorney for the Gray family , told the LA Times that the police \"patrol these neighborhoods like they \u2019 re paramilitary . \u201d <p/>\u201c [ The police ] have a hard time because there \u2019 s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , \u201d a local barber told The New York Times . <p/>\u201c But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . \u201d <p/>Police say that on Saturday around 11 : 30 p . m . Kimani Gray was standing outside his home with five other young men before splitting off when he noticed two plainclothes officers in an unmarked car . <p/>After he \"adjusted his waistband and continued to act in a suspicious manner , \u201d officials say the cops got out of their car and approached Gray \u2014 who allegedly turned toward them with a loaded . 38 - caliber revolver in hand . <p/>The 30 - year - old sergeant and 26 - year - old fired 11 shots \u2014 the autopsy showed that seven bullets entered Gray's body , three of them from the rear . <p/>A revolver loaded with four bullets was reportedly recovered from the scene . <p/>Police commissioner Raymond Kelly told the New York Times there was \u201c nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines \u201d while John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said \"it appears to be a good shooting \u201d under the reported circumstances . <p/>That statement doesn't pacify neighborhood residents , who question the official story \u2014 some in the community don't believe Gray had a gun \u2014 and perceive the officers' behavior as part of a larger trend of NYPD antagonism . <p/>\u201c We \u2019 re talking about a powder keg out here . <p/>Any incident could trigger it , \u201d City Councilman Charles Barron told the LA Times . <p/>On Wednesday tensions \"seemed to be decreasing until Mahnefah Gray , sister of the teen killed by police , was arrested while crossing the street , \" according to Danny Gold of Metropolis .",

Tuesday \u2014 more than four hours after the chaos began \u2014 but did not speak to reporters . <p/>The vigil for Kimani was held at E . 52nd St . and Tilden Ave . , the location of the shooting , which has caused tensions to simmer in the community , in part because the boy \u2019 s family contests police allegations that he was armed with a handgun . <p/>Starting at about 8 p . m . , nearly 100 people set off from the vigil site to march the more than 20 blocks to the precinct stationhouse , on Snyder Ave . near Nostrand Ave . <p/>But the procession , peaceful at first , turned into a wild confrontation between furious marchers and cops after a faction broke off from the group and began to smash car and store windows with rocks and jump on the tops of vehicles , police sources and witnesses said . <p/>\u201c I was sitting in my living room , \u201d said Mary John , 43 , who witnessed destruction near E . 31st St . and Church Ave . <p/>\u201c People were standing up on vehicles . <p/>I saw them take garbage from the sidewalk and throw it onto the street . <p/>I saw someone take a TV and smash it into my neighbor \u2019 s car . <p/>They were throwing rocks at the cars . <p/>\u201c I said , \u2018 Oh my god ! <p/>What \u2019 s going on here ? \u2019 \u201d she continued . <p/>\u201c They were calling out , \u2018 Rest in peace , Kiki . \u2019 <p/>I was shocked . \u201d <p/>Abdoulaye Barry , 24 , who works at African Movies , at Church Ave . and E . 31st St . , described how rioters tried to storm the business . <p/>He said he was outside , saw rioters causing mayhem in the streets , and rushed back to urge his co - workers to lock the store \u2019 s gates . <p/>Rioters rushed the entrance , fighting with workers as they struggled to lock the roll - down gates , he said . <p/>The workers succeeded \u2014 barely . <p/>But they locked themselves into the store from the inside . <p/>Firefighters later had to cut the gates to liberate them . <p/>\u201c It was like the end of the world , \u201d Barry told the Daily News . <p/>\u201c That \u2019 s the first time something like that had happened here . \u201d <p/>At a Rite Aid drug store on Church Ave . near Albany Ave . , which had about 60 people inside at the time , at least one rioter physically assaulted a customer \u2014 cracking him over the head with a glass bottle . <p/>He was rushed to Kings County Hospital and listed in stable condition later , a police spokeswoman said . <p/>A manager of the store was also assaulted ; he refused medical attention , the spokeswoman said . <p/>There were unconfirmed reports the store was looted ; the police spokeswoman said only that the cash registers were not robbed . <p/>When cops finally managed to block the mob \u2019 s progress , about a block from the 67th Precinct stationhouse , rioters began pitching glass bottles at police officers as they moved in on the crowd , a police source said . <p/>One person threw a garbage can at a cop , the source added . <p/>\u201c They \u2019 re acting rowdy and calling us racist , \u201d said a police officer at the scene . <p/>As rioters fled into the night and protestors began making their way back toward E . 52nd St . , Williams joined the fray and tried to prevent more violence . <p/>\u201c The mayor and the [ police ] commissioner should be down here . <p/>Right now ! \u201d <p/>Williams , a critic of NYPD policy , said before Kelly appeared on the scene . <p/>\u201c There \u2019 s a feeling that they don \u2019 t really care . <p/>They are leading and policing for one portion of this city . <p/>But they \u2019 re not paying attention to the other parts ; they \u2019 re not listening to them . \u201d <p/>Public Advocate Bill de Blasio , a Democratic candidate for mayor this year , also came to the area Monday night . <p/>\u201c I understand if young people are frustrated , but we have to help them understand the way to deal with it should be a peaceful way , \u201d he said . <p/>\u201c They have every right to protest \u2014 that \u2019 s the American way . \u201d <p/>Williams said he was not surprised by the riot , only that it hadn \u2019 t happened before . <p/>Critics of the NYPD \u2019 s controversial stop - and - frisk policy argued it leads to distrust of the police by the black community because its members are stopped in such high numbers . <p/>\u201c When something happens , we should be able to trust the police and what they say , \u201d Williams said . <p/>\u201c Police officers shooting black men , black men shooting black men , it \u2019 s a problem that needs to be dealt with . <p/>If they want to ignore it , it \u2019 s just going to keep happening . \u201d <p/>Following the shooting death of Kimani on Saturday , police officials said he flashed a gun at a pair of plainclothes cops who approached a stoop where he and others were hanging out . <p/>Police said a loaded . 38 - caliber revolver was recovered at the scene \u2014 but family of the slain teen , who was hit multiple times by police bullets , vehemently deny that he was carrying a weapon . <p/>Before the riot Monday , a police source told The News that investigators believe Kimani was a member of the Bloods street gang . <p/>The source pointed to two YouTube videos , published last year , that featured violence between Bloods and Crips . <p/>The source said Kimani appears in both videos , which The News has refrained from publishing due to graphic content . <p/>In one video , Kimani is clad in a red Adidas hoodie and goes by the nickname \u201c Shapow , \u201d the source said . <p/>He can be seen taunting and hitting a 13 - year - old rival on Nostrand Ave . near Glenwood Rd . in Flatbush after the adversary flashed gang signs and said he runs with the Crips . <p/>Kimani also swiped a beaded necklace from the Crip and then stomped on it , the video shows , while his friends in the background identified themselves as Bloods . <p/>The second video captured an apparent Crips retaliation following the smackdown . <p/>A group of self - identified Crips stormed a McDonald \u2019 s on Utica Ave . and Ave . H in Flatbush after they spotted Kimani and other alleged Bloods inside , according to the video . <p/>After a minute of heckling and heated exchanges inside the McDonald \u2019 s , the Crips retreated outside . <p/>They mocked Kimani for refusing to come out into the parking lot .",

  "marked_doc": "A sanctuary for dissent in Greece ? <p/>Greek law keeps police away from universities , but some fear the immunity clause meant to protect free speech is now being used to harbor bastions of violence . <p/>Masked men wielding clubs guard the entrance to the Athens Polytechnic University , keeping watch over the graffiti-covered walls on campus . <p/>Nearby streets are barricaded with the carcasses of burnt cars , and a huge black banner proclaims `` MURDERERS '' - the rallying cry that has brought Greece 's youths to the streets . <p/>Inside , piles of empty gas canisters testify to the scores of Molotov cocktails assembled there recently <p/>For more than a week , Athenian streets have been a <mark id=\"mark_id\"> battleground </mark> between police and protesters , whose anger was sparked by the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old boy by a policeman . <p/>Protected by Greece 's Constitution from police interference , the Polytechnic has become the headquarters of the protest movement - and a haven for those wreaking havoc on the city 's streets . <p/>As Greeks try to make sense of the chaos - and prepare for another week of protests , ranging from sit-ins to nationwide roadblocks - many here are beginning to ask whether the asylum law is protecting free speech or simply harboring criminals . <p/>`` The university asylum is for the freedom of movement of ideas , but not of commitment of criminal actions , '' says George Bergeles , a professor at the Polytechnic who is sympathetic to the students ' complaints , but not their harsh tactics . <p/>`` The law about university asylum I believe is a fantastic achievement of the university movement , but we should protect it by not allowing criminal offenses to happen inside . '' <p/>The Polytechnic holds historic importance for Greeks . <p/>In November 1973 , students barricaded themselves inside in rebellion against the country 's military junta , which had been in power since 1967 . <p/>Fearful that the revolt would spread , on Nov. 17 the national police moved in with tanks , killing a still-disputed number of protesters . <p/>The junta fell less than a year later . <p/>Greece 's new Constitution gave special status to universities and other schools , forever barring the police from entering their grounds . <p/>Today , the Poly-technic and other institutions of learning are once again brimming with revolutionary zeal . <p/>Across Athens , high schools and universities are under occupation by students and other youth angry at the Dec. 6 killing of Alexandros Grigoropoulos and also at a political system they see as corrupt and incompetent . <p/>So far , Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis has rejected calls by opposition leaders to hold early elections , but his center-right party holds only a one-seat majority in parliament , and public support for his government was weak even before the riots . <p/>The latest poll numbers show a 20 percent approval rating . <p/>The Polytechnic , which lies on the border of the edgy neighborhood of Exarchia , where the 15-year-old was killed , is serving as the heart and brain center of the revolt . <p/>There , anarchists - many of whom call Exarchia their home - are helping to organize students and other young people . <p/>The area just outside its gates has been the site of some of the most intense clashes with police . <p/>Inside , protesters regroup and rearm around bonfires that burn through the night . <p/>There 's an air of menace outside the Polytechnic . <p/>But Stergia Sarantopoulou , an architecture student there who has been participating in protests , says the mood is angry but collegial . <p/>Like many students , she passionately defends the asylum law . <p/>`` There are historical , political , ideological reasons for the immunity to exist , '' she says . <p/>`` Universities are our home . <p/>It 's the students home ; it 's the teachers home . '' <p/>The university safe-haven policy might at times be abused , Ms. Sarantopoulou says , but in the long run society is better off by having a law that forever ensures a safe place for free speech . <p/>`` It 's much more harmful for the state to control [ universities , ] '' she says . <p/>The explosion of rioting and looting that took place in the aftermath of Alexandros 's death has faded in recent days , but there are still daily protests , many of which end in hails of rocks and flaming Molotov cocktails . <p/>On Saturday , the one-week anniversary of the shooting , the protests were largely peaceful , though still angry . <p/>In daylight , a fragile normality began to return to the city center , with shops again opening and people returning to work . <p/>But at night , uncertain Athenians stayed away from the normally bustling city center , which was ghostly quiet . <p/>Groups of young people roamed the streets across central Athens , shouting: <p/>`` This night is for Alexi ! '' <p/>A heavy cloud of tear gas and smoke hung over Exarchia , which felt like a rebel-held enclave in a city at war . <p/>Police lingered warily on its edges as young people set up burning barricades and attacked government buildings and banks . <p/>And clashes erupted once again outside the Polytechnic . <p/>Few here think the unrest will end anytime soon , and the rage of Greece 's youth continues to smolder . <p/>The death of Alexandros 's has tapped into anger about a range of broader complaints - about corruption , nepotism , a failing education system , and the poor economic prospects of young people , including unemployment rates in the 25 percent range . <p/>Protests are expected to continue throughout the week , with activists calling for roads to be blocked nationwide on Tuesday . <p/>They say they want to bring down Greece 's whole political system - it 's not just the current government that is seen as tainted , most believe the main opposition is little better . <p/>The protesters , however , struggle to articulate exactly what they want in its place . <p/>`` Do n't bend your head down , '' they chanted as they confronted police recently in front of parliament . <p/>`` The only way is resistance .

ET ) the thieves rammed an SUV into the front of the Casty store , near the prestigious Place Vendome , a well - known square in the center of the French capital that is home to a number of jewelers and high - end stores . <p/>After scooping up jewelry and watches estimated to be worth 2 million euros ( $2 . 6 million ) the thieves reversed their car out of the store and <mark id=\"mark_id\"> set fire </mark> to it before making off in another vehicle , Le Monde reported . <p/>The raid comes little over a month after a masked bandit made off with an $136M worth of diamonds and jewels from the Carlton Intercontinental Hotel in Cannes on the glamorous French Riviera , in possibly the world \u2019 s biggest heist . <p/>A lone robber entered through a French door at the side of the building on the famed La Croisette seafront , scooped up the loot and then jumped out of another window . <p/>Despite a huge police investigation , the audacious culprit remains at large . <p/>Thieves also targeted the annual Cannes film festival , stealing almost $2 million of jewelry from the safe in the hotel room of an American jeweler working for Chopard , one of Switzerland \u2019 s most famous diamond merchants . <p/>Days later a $2 . 5 million necklace was lifted by a crook at a movie industry party at the even more exclusive resort of Cap d \u2019 Antibes , near the Italian border .",

J . Hill was placed on IR with a torn triceps that he injured in a preseason game against Houston . <p/>Reggie Bush was lost for half the season after breaking his right fibula in New Orleans \u2019 Sept . 20 win over San Francisco . <p/>A week later , Pierre Thomas went out for nearly nine weeks when he severely sprained his ankle late in New Orleans \u2019 loss to Atlanta . <p/>But while Bush has returned and played in the past six games , Thomas was back for only three games before being listed on the inactive list for the regular season ender against Tampa Bay . <p/>He tweaked the same left ankle that bothered him originally the Friday before the game against the Bucs . <p/>Bell ( 5 - foot - 11 , 220 pounds ) has spent time with the Indianapolis Colts , Philadelphia and Buffalo this season , but has no carries . <p/>He played at Wayne State , where he finished with 6 , 728 yards rushing with 96 touchdowns in addition to 918 yards and four scores receiving .",

'' <p/>Bush was unavailable for comment Wednesday and will see Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham , Ala. , for further evaluation Friday . <p/>He missed games against San Diego , Atlanta , Kansas City and Green Bay midway through this season after getting injured in New Orleans ' 30-7 Oct. 19 loss at Carolina . <p/>Payton pulled Bush in the second half of the loss to the Bears and following the game , Bush expressed frustration with the move . <p/>Saints quarterback Drew Brees understands . <p/>`` He was frustrated. He 's not the only one , '' Brees said . <p/>`` There 's a lot of guys who get frustrated when maybe you want to play and you 're not or you know you 're not 100 percent healthy and it 's affecting you . <p/>That frustrates you . '' <p/>`` He 's used to being the guy , '' Brees continued . <p/>`` He 's used to being the one everyone counts on in the clutch situations , all the way from high school to college . <p/>That 's what 's in his makeup . <p/>That 's what 's in his blood . <p/>He 's an extremely competitive guy .

Certainly it was encouraging . <p/>As we monitor his touches and we look at how many times he gets the ball , be it in the running game and passing game , we 'll find that right balance . ''",

Gigante died while serving a 12 - year sentence imposed in 1997 after he was convicted of racketeering and conspiring to kill other mobsters . <p/>Officials at the prison medical center where he died did not provide the cause of death but noted that he <mark id=\"mark_id\"> suffered </mark> from heart disease . <p/>Mr . Gigante , whose nickname was \"Chin , \" painstakingly maintained the fiction that he was incompetent until April 2003 , when he appeared before Judge I . Leo Glasser in Federal District Court in Brooklyn and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice . <p/>Specifically , he acknowledged running a con on the legal system that delayed his racketeering trial from 1990 to 1997 while his sanity was being examined . <p/>As part of the plea , three more years were added to his prison term , but he avoided a lengthy trial on the other charges , which amounted to an accusation - long denied or sidestepped by Mr . Gigante - that he headed the Genovese organized crime family . <p/>His lawyer , Benjamin Brafman , offered the explanation that \"I think you get to a point in life - I think everyone does - where you become too old and too sick and too tired to fight . \" <p/>For Mr . Gigante , the guise that he adopted in the mid - 1960's - behavior that won him the nickname Oddfather - took considerable effort to maintain . <p/>He could often be seen shuffling around his Greenwich Village neighborhood in pajamas , bathrobe and slippers , mumbling to himself and appearing to be a disturbed but harmless person . <p/>Law - enforcement agents , prosecutors and Mafia defectors described his behavior as a staged performance calculated to evade prosecution for his activities as head of a crime family that under his leadership became the wealthiest and most powerful in the nation . <p/>Based on information from informers and electronic eavesdropping on gangsters , F . B . I . and New York City law - enforcement officials ranked Mr . Gigante as the pre - eminent Mafia leader in the early and mid - 1990's , and prosecutors identified him as the dominant force in the early 1990's inside the Commission , the Mafia's ruling body , which resolves significant disputes among the five major families in the New York region . <p/>His reach , law - enforcement officials said , extended as well to Philadelphia and New England , where he exercised veto power over the appointments of mob bosses in those areas . <p/>Salvatore Gravano , the No . 2 figure in the Gambino crime family before he defected in 1991 , testified that even Mr . Gigante's archrival , John Gotti , grudgingly acknowledged Mr . Gigante's craftiness . <p/>\"He's crazy like a fox , \" Mr . Gravano quoted Mr . Gotti as saying of Mr . Gigante after a summit meeting of New York City mob leaders in 1988 . <p/>Mr . Gotti was the boss of the Gambino family until his own imprisonment forced him to relinquish undisputed control in the late 1990's . <p/>He , too , died in a prison hospital , of cancer in June 2002 . <p/>Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and federal and state prosecutors regarded Mr . Gigante as the most elusive Mafia leader of his era and the most difficult to bring to trial . <p/>\"He was probably the most clever organized - crime figure I have ever seen , \" said John S . Pritchard 3rd , a former F . B . I . supervisor , who led a squad that investigated the Genovese family in the 1980's . <p/>Disputing the government's contentions , Mr . Gigante's lawyers and relatives maintained that he had been mentally disabled since the late 1960's , with a below - normal I . Q . of 69 to 72 . <p/>His defenders steadfastly denied that he was associated with the Mafia , asserting that it was ludicrous to believe that someone so mentally subpar was capable of heading a major crime organization . <p/>The Rev . Louis Gigante , a Roman Catholic priest , former New York city councilman and a builder of low - income housing in the Bronx , characterized the relentless investigations of his older brother as persecution by agents and prosecutors who were biased against Italian - Americans . <p/>Organized - crime experts and mob turncoats said that Mr . Gigante was apparently willing to humiliate himself publicly as the price for escaping the long prison sentences that were being meted out to other Mafia leaders . <p/>According to federal and state investigators , each of the family's 200 \"made\" or inducted soldiers and about 1 , 000 associates - the name for others who voluntarily cooperate in illegal activities but who are not sworn members - were obligated to funnel part of their loot to Mr . Gigante , as much as $100 million a year in the early 1990's . <p/>The family's fortune , the experts said , flowed largely from a vast network of bookmaking and loansharking rings and from extortions of construction companies in the New York City area seeking labor peace or sweetheart contracts from carpenters , teamsters and laborers' unions that were dominated by Mr . Gigante's lieutenants . <p/>Mob deserters in the mid - 1990's testified in criminal and civil cases that the Genovese gang's other lucrative enterprises included the control of cartels that rigged bids and inflated prices in the private garbage - hauling industries of New York City and Westchester County ; kickbacks from shipping and trucking companies on the New Jersey waterfront in exchange for labor peace ; protection payoffs from merchants at the Fulton Fish Market ; and the control of many union jobs at the Jacob K . Javits Convention Center in Manhattan . <p/>Mr . Gigante's influence even extended over the San Gennaro Street Festival in Little Italy until a 1995 crackdown by New York City officials and federal prosecutors resulted in allegations that the Genovese family operated gambling games at the festival , extorted payoffs from venders and pocketed thousands of dollars donated to a neighborhood church . <p/>In the 1980's , after the authorities said Mr . Gigante had assumed undisputed command of the Genovese family , he conducted his activities in a starkly unorthodox fashion for a Mafia leader . <p/>Most days , in the early evening , Mr . Gigante , a hulking man who was about six feet tall and weighed 200 pounds , would emerge from his mother's walkup apartment building on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village . <p/>Sometimes dressed in a bathrobe and pajamas and sometimes wearing a windbreaker and shabby trousers and always accompanied by one or two bodyguards , he gingerly crossed the street to the Triangle Civic Improvement Association , a dingy storefront club that served as his headquarters . <p/>Inside , he played pinochle and held whispered conversations with men who agents said were his trusted confederates . <p/>After midnight , according to F . B . I . surveillance reports , he would be driven to a townhouse near Park Avenue at East 77th Street , that was owned by Olympia Esposito , who was characterized by Mr . Gigante's lawyers as his common - law wife and the mother of three of his eight children , Vincent , Lucia and Carmella Esposito . <p/>F . B . I . agents , who in 1986 observed the townhouse from a nearby rooftop post , said that soon after arriving , Mr . Gigante would change into more elegant clothes , carry on conversations with associates , and read or watch television before retiring . <p/>About 9 or 10 the next morning , he would reappear in his shabby downtown clothes and be driven back to Sullivan Street or a nearby apartment occupied by his relatives at 505 LaGuardia Place . <p/>\"It was hard to understand what enjoyment he got out of being a mob boss , \" said Ronald Goldstock , the former director of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force . <p/>\"His only pleasure appeared to be the pure power he exercised . \" <p/>Vincent Gigante ( pronounced ji - GANT - tee ) was born on March 29 , 1928 , in New York City and grew up on the same streets in Greenwich Village where he would spend most of his adult life . <p/>He was one of five sons of Salvatore Gigante , a watchmaker , and Yolanda Gigante , a seamstress , both of whom had immigrated from Naples . <p/>His mother usually addressed him as \"Cincenzo , \" a diminutive of Vincente , and his boyhood friends shortened that into his lifelong nickname , \"Chin . \" <p/>A lackadaisical student , Mr . Gigante graduated from P . S . 3 , an elementary school in Greenwich Village and dropped out of Textile High School in Manhattan in the ninth grade . <p/>Police detectives said that as a teen - ager , he became a prot\ufffdg\ufffd of Vito Genovese , who was a potent Mafia leader in the United States and in Italy from the 1930's to the 1960's and whose name still describes the organized - crime group he headed until his death in 1969 . <p/>The gang was founded in the 1930's by one of the nation's most notorious criminals , Charles ( Lucky ) Luciano , who was deported to Italy and who died in 1962 . <p/>Mr . Genovese is believed to have endeared himself to the Gigantes when Vincent was a boy with a loan to pay for surgery needed by Mrs . Gigante . <p/>Between age 17 and 25 , Mr . Gigante was arrested seven times on an array of charges : receiving stolen goods , possession of an unlicensed handgun , auto theft , arson and bookmaking . <p/>Most were dismissed or resolved by fines . <p/>His only jail sentence in that period was 60 days for a gambling conviction . <p/>When arrested in his early 20's , he listed his occupation as a tailor . <p/>But as a strapping youth with quick fists , he was better known as a prize fighter . <p/>Mr . Gigante , from age 16 to 19 , fought as a light heavyweight in clubs around town , winning 21 of 25 light - heavyweight bouts , according to Nat Fleischer's Ring Record Book . <p/>Club boxers in those days fought four - and six - round contests in neighborhood arenas , usually getting a percentage of the tickets they themselves sold . <p/>One of Mr . Gigante's managers was a Greenwich Village neighbor , Thomas ( Tommy Ryan ) Eboli , who later became the boss of the Genovese family . <p/>Former New York City detectives who were assigned to organized - crime intelligence units said that Mr . Gigante earned his Mafia spurs as an enforcer in the 1950's . <p/>But his prominence in the underworld surged in 1957 , when Mr . Genovese wrested control of a mob family from Frank Costello , who had been a close friend of Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky and was one of the best - known underworld figures in America . <p/>Mr . Costello retired abruptly as a boss after a gunman grazed his scalp with a bullet in the vestibule of his apartment building on Central Park West . <p/>A doorman identified the 29 - year - old Mr . Gigante as the shooter , but Mr . Costello testified that he was unable to recognize his assailant and Mr . Gigante was acquitted in 1958 on charges of attempted murder . <p/>A year later , he was convicted with Mr . Genovese in Manhattan on federal charges of heroin trafficking . <p/>Mr . Gigante , who listed his profession as the superintendent of a tenement on Bleecker Street , was sentenced to seven years in prison . <p/>The sentencing judge said he would have imposed a longer sentence but was swayed by a flood of letters from residents of Greenwich Village and Little Italy attesting to Mr . Gigante's good character and his work on behalf of juveniles . <p/>He was paroled after five years and detectives said that soon afterward he was promoted from soldier to the rank of capo , or captain , overseeing a group of Mafia gangsters known as a crew , in Greenwich Village . <p/>Although his headquarters was in Lower Manhattan and he spent his nights farther uptown , Mr . Gigante had a home in Old Tappan , N . J . , where he lived with his wife , the former Olympia Grippa , and their three daughters and two sons . <p/>They are Yolanda Fyfe , Roseanne D'Cola and Rita Gigante , and Salvatore and Andrew . <p/>In 1969 , he was indicted in New Jersey on a charge of conspiracy to bribe the entire five - member Old Tappan police force to alert him to surveillance operations by law enforcement agencies . <p/>The accusation was dropped after Mr . Gigante's lawyers presented reports from psychiatrists that he was mentally unfit to stand trial . <p/>Mafia informers and defectors said that Mr . Gigante gained control of the Genovese family in a peaceful transition in the early 1980's when the group's acting boss , Philip Lombardo , stepped down because of ill health , and Mr . Gigante's main rival , Anthony Salerno , was imprisoned for life on racketeering charges . <p/>Mr . Salerno died in federal prison in 1992 . <p/>As a new godfather , Mr . Gigante quickly imposed extraordinary security measures . <p/>Genovese soldiers and associates were forbidden to utter his name or nickname in conversations or telephone calls . <p/>When references to him had to be made , capos and soldiers would silently point to their chins or form the letter \"C\" with their fingers . <p/>Mr . Gigante was indicted in 1990 with 14 others on federal charges in Brooklyn that they had conspired to rig bids and extort payoffs from contractors on multimillion - dollar contracts with the New York City Housing Authority to install windows . <p/>At his arraignment , he appeared in court in his familiar pajamas and bathrobe and a peaked cap . <p/>Because of defense contentions that he was mentally and physically impaired , his case was severed from the other defendants and legal battles ensued for seven years over his competence to stand trial . <p/>A superseding indictment in 1993 brought more serious accusations against him . <p/>Mr . Gigante was charged with being the head of the Genovese family and sanctioning the murders of six mobsters and conspiring to kill three others , including John Gotti , the boss of the Gambino family . <p/>Mr . Gigante , the indictment asserted , wanted Mr . Gotti eliminated because he had violated Mafia protocol by arranging the assassination of the previous Gambino boss , Paul Castellano , without seeking Mr . Gigante's approval . <p/>The evidence in both indictments stemmed mainly from deserters from the Genovese and other mob families who entered the Government's Witness Protection Program . <p/>At sanity hearings in March 1996 , Mr . Gravano of the Gambino family , and Alphonse D'Arco , the former acting boss of another New York Mafia organization , the Lucchese crime family , testified that Mr . Gigante was lucid during top - level Mafia meetings and that he had acknowledged to other gangsters that his eccentric behavior was a pretense . <p/>Mr . Gigante's lawyers elicited testimony and reports from psychiatrists and psychologists that from 1969 to 1995 , he had been confined 28 times in hospitals for treatment of hallucinations and that he suffered from \"dementia rooted in organic brain damage . \" <p/>In August 1996 , Judge Eugene H . Nickerson of Federal District Court in Brooklyn ruled that Mr . Gigante was mentally competent to stand trial on murder and racketeering charges . <p/>The judge found that at least until 1991 , Mr . Gigante had engaged in an \"elaborate deception\" with the help of his relatives to deceive psychiatrists about his condition . <p/>Before the trial began , Mr . Gigante , who had open - heart surgery in 1988 , had another cardiac operation in December 1996 , putting his fitness to stand trial in doubt once again . <p/>Mr . Gigante had pleaded not guilty and had been free for years on $1 million bond . <p/>During the monthlong trial in 1997 , a gaunt - looking Mr . Gigante sat in a wheelchair , looking blankly into space as witnesses testified and lawyers argued . <p/>He did not testify . <p/>After three days of deliberations , the jury on July 25 , 1997 , convicted him on charges of running multimillion - dollar rackets as the Genovese family chief and of conspiring unsuccessfully in the late 1980's to murder Mr . Gotti and a Genovese family defector . <p/>But he was acquitted of ordering three other gangland slayings and the jury was deadlocked on accusations that he ordered four other murders . <p/>Imposing a sentence of 12 years - instead of a possible maximum of 27 years - and a $1 . 25 million fine , Judge Jack B . Weinstein of Federal District Court in Brooklyn reflected in December 1997 on Mr . Gigante's career . <p/>\"He is a shadow of his former self , \" the judge said , \"an old man finally brought to bay in his declining years after decades of vicious criminal tyranny . \"",

J . <p/>He was known as \"Chin , \" and his moniker was often invoked by denizens of the Mafia underworld with a hand - to - chin gesture rather than a word , the better to foil police bugs . <p/>To the writers of headlines he was sometimes \"Daffy Don\" or \"the Oddfather\" for his habit of walking the streets of the West Village clad in a bathrobe , striped pyjamas , and slippers , while muttering incoherently . <p/>Federal prosecutors claimed it was an act , but it was not until 2003 , after more than three decades of faking mental illness , that Gigante admitted in court that he did it to avoid prosecution . <p/>His admission came as part of a plea deal on behalf of his son , Andrew , also convicted of mob - related activities . <p/>For two decades , Gigante was head of the Genovese crime family , which emerged as the largest of the five New York Mafia clans after decades of concerted federal prosecutions decimated its rivals . <p/>It was estimated that there were some 300 members of the family under his control . <p/>The Genovese rackets included guaranteeing labor peace to firms in construction , garbage removal , and trucking ; extorting payoffs from companies doing business at the Ports of Newark and Elizabeth ; various rackets at the Fulton Fish Market and the Jacob K . Javits Convention Center ; contracts for window - installation in city housing , and the old standbys of bookmaking , loan - sharking , and narcotics . <p/>It was narcotics that first sent Gigante to prison , in 1959 , when he received a five - year sentence after being caught conspiring to smuggle heroin from abroad . <p/>Also sentenced in the case was the man who gave his name to the crime family , Vito Genovese . <p/>Genovese ran his organization from behind bars while serving a 15 - year sentence . <p/>It was a similar ruse - maintaining control of the family while incarcerated by transmitting orders through his son , Andrew - that was Gigante's downfall . <p/>Gigante was born in the Bronx to parents who were immigrants from Naples , Italy . <p/>His father was a jewelry engraver , and his mother was a seamstress . <p/>Born Vincenzo , he was called \"Chin\" for short , and his prominent chin probably helped the name stick . <p/>He put it to good use as a teenage boxer , winning 21 of 25 club fights . <p/>Gigante was arrested several times from when he was 17 to 25 , for possession of an unlicensed handgun , gambling , bookmaking , grand larceny , and arson . <p/>Two of his brothers , Mario and Ralph , were also identified as Mafia soldiers , while another , Louis , was a prominent Catholic priest as well as a Democratic politician in the Bronx . <p/>In 1957 Gigante was charged with attempted murder in the shooting of Frank Costello , then the head of what would be called the Genovese family . <p/>He was acquitted despite the testimony of a doorman who claimed to have witnessed the crime ; Costello himself claimed not to have seen his assailant , despite being shot at close range from the front . <p/>The shot had only \"creased his head , \" according to reports at the time . <p/>The prosecutor in the Costello case claimed that Gigante was \"a young punk on the way up in the underworld who was chosen to kill Costello to win his spurs . \" <p/>If so , it seemed to have worked , despite his having missed . <p/>Costello retired soon after , and Genovese assumed control of the family , which had a history going back to Lucky Luciano . <p/>After serving five years on the 1959 heroin conviction , Gigante resumed his life of crime . <p/>He first sought psychiatric help in 1966 , while under investigation for bribing New York City police . <p/>In 1970 , he was indicted for bribing the entire five - man police force of Old Tappan , N . J . , a small town in Bergen County where he had moved . <p/>After he produced evidence that he was under psychiatric care at St . Vincent's hospital in Westchester , the court ruled that he was mentally incompetent to testify in the case . <p/>It was a pattern Gigante would repeat in the coming decades , including committing himself several times when prosecutions threatened . <p/>Gigante's immediate family supported him , especially Louis , the glad - handing , cigar - smoking priest and builder of low - income housing , who told reporters his brother had paranoid schizophrenia , dementia , and Alzheimer's disease . <p/>Federal marshals serving him with a subpoena at his mother's Sullivan Street apartment house once found him standing under the shower , fully clothed , holding an umbrella . <p/>\"Vincenzo ? <p/>He is the boss of the toilet ! \" <p/>his mother told New York Post columnist Cindy Adams . <p/>Gigante , meantime , was consolidating his power within the Genovese family . <p/>In the late 1970s , he ran a crew in Lower Manhattan , operating waterfront rackets , as well as loan - sharking and gambling in New Jersey . <p/>He emerged as head of the Genovese family by the early 1980s . <p/>Federal prosecutors kept him under observation for decades , and Gigante kept up the crazy act with amazing consistency . <p/>He spent much of each day walking around the Village in his bed clothes and playing cards at his Triangle Civic Improvement Association on Mulberry Street . <p/>A sign hung on the wall warning business associates against loose talk : \"This place is bugged . \" <p/>By the late 1980s , he rarely went to Old Tappan , preferring to spend his nights on the Upper East Side with his mistress , with whom he had three children . <p/>Oddly , both his wife and his mistress were named Olympia . <p/>Gigante's mental illness act allowed him to escape trial despite being indicted numerous times on charges ranging from bid rigging and extortion to conspiracy to commit eight murders . <p/>His luck held until 1997 , when a New York jury found him guilty of a range of charges and sentenced him to 12 years in the federal penitentiary . <p/>It may have been a bad omen that the judge in the case , Jack B . Weinstein , insisted that Gigante wear a suit rather than a bathrobe to his trial . <p/>At the Palma Boys Social Club in East Harlem in 1985 , the FBI taped the following exchange between two Genovese family members , Anthony \"Fat Tony\" Salerno and Giuseppe Sabato : <p/>Salerno : He's got to worry if he gets pinched , all them years he spent in that [ expletive deleted ] asylum . <p/>Sabato : That's what I'm saying . <p/>Salerno : For nothing . <p/>Vincent L . Gigante <p/>Born March 29 , 1928 , in the Bronx ; died December 19 at the U . S .

'' <p/>McAfee Avert Labs researchers reported variants of the IE exploit that attempt to infect users via an ActiveX control that stores the malicious exploit code , stealthily running in the background of a Microsoft Word document . <p/>Malware is then installed on the vulnerable computer once users open up a Word document -- all without their knowledge or permission . <p/>`` We 've seen some pretty clever ways of people trying to take advantage of this , '' said Marcus . <p/>`` It just speaks to the fact that they look for clever , very unique ways to get malware onto your system . '' <p/>Security experts strongly recommend that users apply Microsoft 's latest IE patch as soon as possible , which can be downloaded from the Microsoft Web site .",

  "marked_doc": "Microsoft releases emergency patch for IE <p/>Microsoft on Wednesday released an emergency patch to <mark id=\"mark_id\"> fix </mark> a perilous software flaw allowing hackers to hijack Internet Explorer browsers and take over computers . <p/>The US software giant said security update MS08-078 addresses a vulnerability cyber-criminals can exploit to their advantage . <p/>`` Microsoft encourages all IE customers to test and deploy this update as soon as possible , '' said Microsoft security response communications head Christopher Budd . <p/>The threat led Microsoft to mobilize security engineering teams worldwide to deliver a software cure `` in the unprecedented time of eight days . '' <p/>According to researchers at software security firm Trend Micro , attacks based on the vulnerability in the world 's most popular Web browser were spreading `` like wildfire '' with millions of computers already compromised . <p/>Microsoft typically releases patches for its software on the second Tuesday of each month and rushing this fix to computer users out-of-cycle is testimony to the severe danger of the threat , according to Trend Micro . <p/>`` People should run , not walk , to get it installed , '' said Trend Micro advanced threat researcher Paul Ferguson . <p/>`` This vulnerability is being actively exploited by cyber-criminals and getting worse every day . '' <p/>The IE software patch will be automatically applied to hundreds of millions of personal computers due to standard update settings in the machines , according to Microsoft Security Response Alliance director Mike Reavey . <p/>Wednesday morning , business networks using IE began getting the critical fix through routine patching processes . <p/>Reavey said Microsoft went into `` emergency response '' mode on December 9 after it first learned of the attacks on IE browsers . <p/>A day later , Microsoft published a security advisory that `` listed workarounds that blocked all known attacks . '' <p/>`` Over the course of the next eight days , this advisory was updated five times , adding newer workarounds and mitigations , '' Reavey said . <p/>`` We also continually monitored the threat environment , noting when the attacks began to change in nature and scope . '' <p/>Trend Micro has identified about 10,000 websites that have been infected with malicious software that can be surreptitiously slipped into visitors ' unprotected IE browsers to take advantage of the flaw . <p/>A major Internet portal in Taiwan is among the legitimate websites unknowingly tainted with malicious software aimed at IE 's weak spot , according to Ferguson . <p/>Hackers can take control of infected computers , steal data , redirect browsers to dubious websites , and use machines for devious activities such as attacks on other networks , according to security specialists . <p/>`` What makes this so insidious is it takes advantage of a big gaping hole of IE , which has the largest install base of any browser on the market , '' Ferguson said . <p/>IE is used on nearly three-quarters of the world 's computers , according to industry statistics from November . <p/>Reavey said the patch consists of more than 300 distinct updates for more than half-a-dozen versions of IE in scores of languages . <p/>Analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group in Silicon Valley said it was `` amazing '' that Microsoft was able to turn out a complex critical fix in a week when such jobs typically can take a month or longer of intense work . <p/>`` Even with that , the release Emergency Response process is n't over , '' Reavey said . <p/>`` There is additional support to customers and additional refinement of our product development efforts . '' <p/>Trend Micro urges IE users to heed precautionary advice from Microsoft , or avoid using the browsers , until the patches are applied . <p/>The `` exploit '' is similar to one used recently to steal user names , passwords and other information from people playing online games in China , according to Trend Micro .",

'' <p/>The flaw lies in the way Internet Explorer 's data-binding function works , Microsoft said . <p/>When the browser is attacked it will crash , corrupting the computer 's memory and allowing the criminal to run unauthorized software . <p/>View more related contentView all related articles <p/>Because Internet Explorer is used by about 70 percent of Web surfers , this attack code will probably show up in widely used malicious software toolkits `` very shortly , '' Howard said . <p/>Other security companies agreed with Verisign 's assessment . <p/>`` Microsoft 's latest IE out-of-band patch release needs to be installed right away , '' said Shavlik Technologies in a statement . <p/>`` The number of infected Web sites is growing at an alarming rate -- even people visiting legitimate Web sites are getting hacked with this exploit . '' <p/>The flaw is so serious , in fact , that Microsoft took the unusual step of issuing its security fix weeks ahead of schedule . <p/>Typically Microsoft releases security patches just once a month in order to simplify the lives of system administrators . <p/>Its next set of updates is due Jan. 13 . <p/>Criminals could also launch their attacks via e-mail , by sending victims maliciously encoded HTML documents , although this type of attack has not been reported . <p/>Microsoft 's patch is for users of IE version 5 and up .",

'' <p/>On the heels of the Yahoo deal that fell apart V 2 , comeback CEO Jerry Yang was skewered by the able hands of Web 2.0 Summit host John Battelle . <p/>Paul Martino , CEO of Aggregate Knowledge , talks about the company 's `` online discovery '' tool , which essentially looks across hundreds of millions of Web sites and recommends content , products , and services to users in real time . <p/>Mashmaker allows developers to add a bit of JavaScript to any page and have that page automatically populated with appropriate widgets , making the page more useful for site visitors . <p/>Nonetheless , Microsoft lists Internet Explorer 5.01 , 6 , and 7 as affected software in its Security Bulletin . <p/>It also says separately , in the FAQ section , that Internet Explorer 8 Beta 2 is affected . <p/>The vulnerability can be exploited through JavaScript code posted on malicious Web sites . <p/>Internet Explorer users may be redirected to these sites through hacked legitimate sites . <p/>If the malicious code is successful , it silently downloads malware onto the victim 's computer . <p/>Microsoft typically releases software patches , referred to as Security Bulletins , on the second Tuesday of every month . <p/>When critical vulnerabilities emerge and are actively exploited , Microsoft often issues a patch as soon as it 's ready . <p/>The last such out-of-band patch , Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-067 , was released on Oct. 23 . <p/>It addressed a vulnerability in Windows Server service that affected all currently supported versions of Windows . <p/>That vulnerability allowed an attacker to take over affected computers remotely . <p/>When Microsoft issued its out-of-band patch in October , it cited the vulnerability 's potential `` wormability '' -- meaning the hole could be exploited on a massive scale using self-copying malware -- as a reason for its action . <p/>But MS08-078 is n't wormable . <p/>`` That shows that the wormability of a vulnerability is no longer a good indicator of the seriousness of a threat and that these Web-based threats are now much more dangerous than network worms , '' said Roel Schouwenberg , senior antivirus researcher for Kaspersky Lab , Americas , in an e-mailed statement . <p/>Indeed , Microsoft security researchers estimated that as many as 1 in 500 users of Internet Explorer could have been exposed to malware attempting to exploit the flaw . <p/>`` The browser flaw had been disclosed roughly one week ago as a zero-day vulnerability , and active exploits have been around the Internet for that timeframe as well , '' Qualys CTO Wolfgang Kandek said in an e-mailed statement . <p/>`` The workarounds provided by Microsoft were very technical and quite cumbersome to implement , making it imperative for Microsoft to release a fix as quickly as possible . '' <p/>Kandek suggests that Microsoft is at a disadvantage in updating Internet Explorer because its browser does n't have a built-in update mechanism like other browser makers . <p/>Mozilla , for instance , just released Firefox 3.05 to Firefox users through its auto-update system . <p/>Microsoft is urging users of IE to test and deploy this update as soon as possible .",

'' <p/>Computers that are set to automatically update and install software will already be protected by the patch . <p/>Those users who manage their own updates are advised to download the fix as soon as possible from the Microsoft website . <p/>`` When the patch is released , people should run , not walk , to get it installed , '' said Paul Ferguson , a researcher with Trend Micro . <p/>`` This vulnerability is being actively exploited by cyber criminals and getting worse every day . '' <p/>It is thought that the security flaw , which came to light earlier this week , was exposed by accident , after a Chinese security firm , Knowsec , released details of the loophole believing Microsoft had already issued a software fix to resolve it . <p/>However , technology experts have warned that malware authors , who write the viruses and code that exploits security vulnerabilities , are already working on ways to get around the software update . <p/>`` We are seeing customised versions of the IE 7 exploit with varying degrees of obfuscation , '' wrote McAfee security expert Rahul Mohandas on the company blog . <p/>`` Malware authors have been coming up with innovative mechanisms to leverage this exploit to social engineer the not so tech-savvy internet users .

  "marked_doc": "http : / / www . computerworld . com / s / article / 9242469 / Hackers _ exploit _ critical _ IE _ bug _ Microsoft _ promises _ patch <p/>Hackers exploit critical IE bug ; Microsoft promises patch <p/>IE6 through IE11 harbor vulnerability , but in - the - wild attacks limited to IE8 and IE9 <p/>September 17 , 2013 03 : 16 PM ET <p/>Computerworld - Microsoft today said that hackers are exploiting a critical , but unpatched , vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8 ( IE8 ) and Internet Explorer 9 ( IE9 ) , and that its engineers are working on an update to <mark id=\"mark_id\"> plug </mark> the hole . <p/>As it often does , the company downplayed the threat . <p/>\"There are only reports of a limited number of targeted attacks specifically directed at Internet Explorer 8 and 9 , although the issue could potentially affect all supported versions , \" Dustin Childs , a manager in the Trustworthy Computing group and its usual spokesman , said in a blog post Tuesday morning . <p/>\"We are actively working to develop a security update to address this issue , \" Childs added . <p/>According to Childs and the security advisory Microsoft also published today , the vulnerability affects all supported versions of IE , from the 12 - year - old IE6 to the not - yet - officially - released IE11 , the browser that will accompany Windows 8 . 1 when it ships Oct . 18 . <p/>\"There is no escaping this one , \" said Andrew Storms , director of DevOps at cloud security vendor CloudPassage , referring to the bug affecting all versions of Microsoft's browser . <p/>\"IE zero - days are never a good thing , especially when they affect every version , \" Storms added . <p/>Although Microsoft's advisory did not put it in these terms , the vulnerability can be exploited using classic \"drive - by\" attack tactics . <p/>That means hackers need only lure victims running IE to malicious sites - - or legitimate websites that have previously been compromised and loaded with attack code - - to hijack their browser and plant malware on their Windows PCs . <p/>Until Microsoft produces a patch , the company offered customers several options to protect themselves , including advice on configuring EMET 4 . 0 and running one of its \"Fixit\" automated tools to \"shim\" the DLL that contains the IE rendering engine . <p/>EMET ( Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit ) is a tool designed for advanced users , primarily enterprise IT professionals , that manually enables anti - exploit technologies such as ASLR ( address space layout randomization ) and DEP ( data execution prevention ) for specific applications . <p/>But the Fixit route will be easiest for individual users : Microsoft's posted a link to the Fixit tool on its support site , and customers need only click the icon marked \"Enable . \" <p/>Microsoft has used the shim approach before when faced with unexpected attacks against IE . <p/>Based on past practice , Microsoft's Fixit workaround probably uses the Application Compatibility Toolkit to modify the core library of IE - - a DLL ( dynamic link library ) named \"Mshtml . dll\" that contains the browser's rendering engine - - in memory each time IE runs . <p/>The shim does not quash the bug , but instead makes the browser immune to the attacks Microsoft's seen in the wild thus far . <p/>Users can also temporarily ditch IE for an alternate browser , such as Google's Chrome or Mozilla's Firefox , to stay safe until Microsoft comes up with a permanent fix . <p/>Microsoft today declined say when it plans to patch the IE vulnerability . <p/>But because the next regularly - scheduled Patch Tuesday is three weeks away , it's possible the Redmond , Wash . company's security team will deliver a so - called \"out - of - band\" update before Oct . 9 . <p/>Out - of - band updates from Microsoft are rare : The last one it shipped was MS13 - 008 , an the emergency patch issued Jan . 14 that plugged a hole in IE6 , IE7 and IE8 that had been exploited since early December 2012 .",

  "marked_doc": "Microsoft issues patch to fix IE <p/>Microsoft has issued a security patch to <mark id=\"mark_id\"> fix </mark> a critical vulnerability in its Internet Explorer browser which it said has attacked over 2m Windows users . <p/>The flaw is believed to have already infected as many as 10,000 websites . <p/>The `` zero day '' exploit let criminals take over victims ' computers by steering them to infected websites . <p/>Microsoft 's Christopher Budd said the software giant `` encourages all IE customers to test and deploy this update as soon as possible '' . <p/>He also said the threat led Microsoft to mobilise security engineering teams worldwide to deliver a software cure `` in the unprecedented time of eight days '' . <p/>The company 's security response team said the patch consists of more than 300 distinct updates for more than half-a-dozen versions of IE in around 50 languages . <p/>`` Even with that , the release Emergency Response process is n't over , '' said Security Response Alliance director Mike Reavey . <p/>`` There is additional support to customers and additional refinement of our product development efforts . '' <p/>Microsoft stressed that the flaw was proven to exist only in IE 7 on all applicable versions of Windows , but that IE 6 and the `` beta '' release of IE 8 were `` potentially vulnerable '' . <p/>Users who have automatic updates turned on will receive the patch over the next 24 hours while others can access it via a download . <p/>The AZN Trojan has been making the rounds since the beginning of December but became public knowledge in the last week . <p/>Unlike other exploits , users only have to visit a malicious site with Trojans or other malware in order to become contaminated . <p/>Once an infected web page is opened , malicious downloaders are installed on the computer designed to record keystrokes and steal passwords , credit card details and other financial information . <p/>The sites affected are mostly Chinese and have been serving up programmes to steal passwords for computer games which can then be sold for cash on the black market . <p/>Internet Explorer is the world 's most widely used web browser with nearly three quarters of the market share . <p/>Microsoft estimated that one in every 500 Windows users had been exposed to sites that tried to exploit the flaw and the number of victims was increasing at a rate of 50 % daily . <p/>Researchers at the software security firm Trend Micro said attacks were spreading `` like wildfire '' . <p/>`` This vulnerability is being actively exploited by cyber-criminals and getting worse every day , '' said the company 's advanced threat researcher Paul Ferguson . <p/>Microsoft labelled the bug as `` critical , '' the most serious threat ranking in its four-step scoring programme . <p/>The update is something of an unusual move for Microsoft and underscores the seriousness of the zero day flaw . <p/>The company rarely issues security fixes for its software outside of its regular monthly patch updates . <p/>Meanwhile Mozilla has released a scheduled update for its open source Firefox web browsers for at least 10 different vulnerabilities . <p/>The bugs in the browser could have been `` used to run attacker code and install software , requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing , '' said Mozilla . <p/>It is also reissuing calls for users to upgrade from Firefox 2.0 to Firefox 3.0 as soon as possible and said it is `` not planning any further security and stability updates for Firefox 2 '' . <p/>This means Mozilla will no longer support the Firefox 2 browser against future online scams and attacks .",

Mark Felt , who as a senior Federal Bureau of Investigation official , served as the shadowy source <mark id=\"mark_id\"> known </mark> as `` Deep Throat '' to reporter Bob Woodward in his investigation of the Watergate scandal that led to President Nixon 's resignation . <p/>As Johanna Neuman writes in a Los Angeles Times piece: <p/>A controversial figure who was later convicted of authorizing illegal activities in pursuit of members of the radical Weather Underground , Felt died of heart failure Thursday at his home in Santa Rosa , Calif. , his grandson Rob Jones said . <p/>Felt was deputy associate director of the FBI in 1972 when he began supplying information to Bob Woodward , who with Carl Bernstein made up The Post 's investigative duo who doggedly pursued the story of the Watergate break-in and a conspiracy that led directly to President Richard M. Nixon , who ultimately resigned . <p/>The reporters continued to keep Felt 's name a secret , but in 2005 , at the age of 91 , Felt told Vanity Fair magazine , `` I 'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat . '' <p/>His disclosure ended a mystery that had intrigued Washington insiders and journalists for three decades and provided the grist for many hotly debated newspaper and magazine articles . <p/>While Felt 's name was raised as a suspect on several occasions , he always managed to deflect attention , usually by saying that if had been Deep Throat he would have done a better job of exposing the wrongdoings at the White House . <p/>His disclosure in a Vanity Fair article by his family 's lawyer , John D. O'Connor , provoked a national debate: <p/>Was he a hero who should be lauded for sparing the country the strain of further high crimes and misdemeanors by the Nixon White House ? <p/>Or was he a traitor who betrayed not only his president but his oath of office by disclosing grand jury information and the contents of FBI files ? <p/>For the most part , reaction split along political lines . <p/>`` There 's nothing heroic about breaking faith with your people , '' said commentator Patrick J. Buchanan , a former Nixon speechwriter . <p/>Felt `` disgraced himself and dishonored everything an FBI agent should stand for . '' <p/>But Richard Ben-Veniste , a key lawyer in the Watergate prosecution team , said Felt 's role showed that `` the importance of whistle-blowers should n't be underestimated , particularly when there are excesses by the executive branch of government -- which in this case went all the way to the executive office .

  "marked_doc": "http : / / www . nytimes . com / 2004 / 07 / 29 / politics / 29larueobit . html <p/>Fred LaRue , Watergate Figure , Dies at 75 <p/>Published : July 29 , 2004 <p/>Frederick C . LaRue , a top Nixon campaign official who passed money from a secret White House fund to buy the <mark id=\"mark_id\"> silence </mark> of the Watergate burglars , died Saturday at a hotel in Biloxi , Miss . <p/>He was 75 . <p/>His heart failed while he was reading a book , his son , Ike LaRue III , said . <p/>He lived in Biloxi and Jackson , Miss . <p/>Fred LaRue's career was intertwined with that of Richard M . Nixon from the time he transferred his considerable financial support to Nixon from the defeated presidential candidate Barry Goldwater in 1964 . <p/>He was an architect of Nixon's successful strategy for capturing Southern votes and then a significant participant in the Watergate scandal . <p/>Mr . LaRue pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in July 1973 . <p/>He served a reduced sentence of four and a half months in federal prison in return for cooperating with prosecutors investigating the break - in at the Watergate complex , which housed the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee , on June 17 , 1972 . <p/>He was at the meeting in Key Biscayne , Fla . , on March 30 , 1972 , where John N . Mitchell , the former attorney general who became head of Nixon's re - election campaign committee , and Jeb Stuart Magruder , Mr . Mitchell's deputy , approved a \"dirty tricks\" campaign , including the Watergate break - in . <p/>Mr . LaRue was also at the meeting after the break - in at which some of the same officials scurried to come up with money for the burglars . <p/>Mr . LaRue personally delivered payments . <p/>Nixon acknowledged his own involvement in the cover - up , but always denied advance knowledge of the break - in . <p/>In a heated exchange with Mr . Magruder in 2003 , Mr . LaRue supported Nixon's claim of ignorance of the initial burglary . <p/>Mr . LaRue's main argument was that he had been in charge of the phone at a Florida meeting of the top campaign staff where the break - in was planned and was monitoring all calls . <p/>Nixon never called , he said in an interview with The Sun Herald , a Biloxi newspaper . <p/>Also , he said his personal relationship with Mitchell was so close that Mitchell would certainly have told him . <p/>Mr . LaRue denied suggestions that he was \"Deep Throat , \" the secret Watergate source used by Bob Woodward in his joint coverage of the scandal with Carl Bernstein for The Washington Post . <p/>Mr . LaRue said he believed the secret informer was an amalgam of several people , but Mr . Woodward has said that it is one person and that he will reveal that person's identity after his death . <p/>Mr . LaRue , whose family amassed a fortune in the oil business , played an important role with Nixon many years before Watergate . <p/>After contributing heavily to Goldwater's losing presidential campaign in 1964 , he became a leading supporter of Nixon . <p/>In particular , he helped develop a \"Southern strategy\" for the Republicans to recapture Southern states from the Democrats . <p/>After Nixon's election in 1968 , Mr . LaRue worked in the White House without title or salary . <p/>Partly through his friendship with Senator James O . Eastland , the Mississippi Democrat who was chairman of the Judiciary Committee , Mr . LaRue helped to win confirmation for Nixon's nominees to the federal bench . <p/>\"He was an elusive , anonymous , secret operator at the highest levels of the shattered Nixon power structure , \" The New York Times reported in 1973 . <p/>\"He is a man of personal mystery , too - a latter - day character , it sometimes seemed , out of a Southern gothic novel . \" <p/>Frederick Cheney LaRue was born Oct . 11 , 1928 , in Athens , Tex . <p/>His father , Ike Parsons LaRue Sr . , whom Fred LaRue shot and killed in a Canadian duck - hunting accident in 1957 , was a first cousin of Sid Richardson , the Texas oil and ranching tycoon . <p/>The elder Mr . LaRue had gone to jail for banking violations and moved to Mississippi to look for oil . <p/>His company discovered the giant Bolton field , which Fred's generation sold for $30 million in 1967 . <p/>Fred LaRue spread money to local and national politicians , and , despite his shyness , acquired the nickname Bubba . <p/>He became a Republican national committeeman . <p/>In the end , Mr . LaRue was one of the first top Nixon aides to cooperate with prosecutors . <p/>\"LaRue had stressed that it was time for both of us to think about protecting ourselves and our families instead of continuing to worry about protecting Mitchell and the president , \" Mr . Magruder wrote in his 1974 book , \"An American Life : One Man's Road to Watergate . \" <p/>Mr . LaRue is survived by his wife , Joyce Burleson LaRue ; his sons Ike III , of Jackson , and Fred Jr . , of Brandon , Miss . ; his daughters Patricia LaRue of Arlington , Tex . , Leslie LaRue of Manhattan , Grace Burleson LaRue of Crystal Springs , Miss . ; his brother , Ike Jr . ; his sister , Ruthie LaRue Owen of Jackson ; and nine grandchildren . <p/>In the interview with The Sun Herald , Mr . LaRue guessed that the healthy regimen of his months in prison added 10 years to his life . <p/>\"The warden let me make a badminton court out of the volleyball court , \" he said . <p/>\"We had some of the best badminton players in the country . \"",

' <p/>A debonair man about town and incurable political gossip , Mr Felt was already known to Mr Woodward when he first reached out to him . <p/>Soon he was arranging cloak and dagger meetings with the young reporters in darkened parking garages across the Potomac River . <p/>The chain-smoking FBI-man provided an insight into the scale of the presidential scandal that was larger than anyone had imagined . <p/>`` Deep Throat '' , the name given to him at the Washington Post , was a wordplay based on a well known pornographic movie and his insistence on remaining on `` deep background '' despite the sensational nature of his revelations . <p/>From the outset President Nixon suspected him of being the leaker and five times ordered the FBI director Patrick Gray to fire him . <p/>Felt 's adamant denials were convincing enough and he was never sacked . <p/>Deep Throat continued to leak and on the assumption that he was being monitored he had elaborate procedures for contacting Mr Woodward . <p/>When he had information to pass on , he would arrange meetings by circling the page number on page twenty of the reporter 's copy of The New York Times and then drawing the hands of a clock to signal the hour . <p/>If Mr Woodward wanted to see him he would simply place a red flag in a flowerpot on the balcony of his P street apartment . <p/>Over the course of the scandal , Deep Throat supplied crucial information for some 400 Washington Post stories . <p/>The reporters went on to win a Pulitzer prize , journalism 's highest accolade . <p/>A master of the black arts of disinformation , at FBI headquarters he alighted on a newspaper story for which he was not the source and ordered an investigation to find the leaker . <p/>He then fingered a prosecutor as the source . <p/>Mr Woodward wrote in his 2006 expose , `` Secret Man : The Story of Watergate 's Deep Throat '' that `` The memo was an effective cover for him , the very best counterintelligence tradecraft . <p/>Not only had he initiated the leak inquiry , but Felt appeared to have discovered the leaker . '' <p/>By then Deep Throat 's real identity had already been revealed in Vanity Fair magazine . <p/>More than 30 years after Watergate and Mr Woodward confirmed the revelation , finally letting his secret out . <p/>By then Mr Felt was suffering from dementia and had little or no memory of his role in history . <p/>Though Deep Throat was a hero to the anti Vietnam War movement and the left , Mr Felt was no liberal . <p/>A law and order crime-fighter , he ran the agency 's `` goon squad '' to monitor agents in the field . <p/>He also advised Hollywood for its 1965 television series The FBI , ensuring that G-men were always shown in the most favourable light . <p/>Long after Watergate he was convicted of running his own so called `` black bag '' burglaries of the radical Weather Underground movement . <p/>He was later pardoned by President Ronald Reagan . <p/>In a 1979 book , he bragged about the FBI 's bugging of the Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King and he vehemently opposed the hiring of women agents by the FBI .",

  "marked_doc": "http : / / articles . latimes . com / 2004 / jul / 29 / local / me - larue29 <p/>Frederick LaRue , 75 ; Had Key Role in Coverup of the Watergate Break - In <p/>July 29 , 2004 <p/>Frederick C . LaRue , a Mississippi oil heir who became the first person <mark id=\"mark_id\"> found </mark> guilty of participating in the Watergate coverup and was among those rumored to be the mysterious Deep Throat , has died at 75 . <p/>LaRue's body was found Tuesday by a maid at the Biloxi hotel where he was staying . <p/>The Harrison County , Miss . , coroner , Gary Hargrove , told the Associated Press that LaRue is believed to have died Saturday of natural causes . <p/>A close friend and associate of John Mitchell - - President Nixon's attorney general and later his reelection campaign director - - LaRue became a trusted member of the administration in 1969 , even though he did not have a salary , a title or a listing in the White House directory . <p/>Described as a skillful behind - the - scenes operator , he was present at a key meeting in 1972 between Mitchell and Nixon aide Jeb Stuart Magruder when the plan to break into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington allegedly was approved . <p/>LaRue became a central figure in the Watergate coverup as the \"bagman\" who delivered hush money to participants in the bungled break - in . <p/>On June 27 , 1973 , he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiring to obstruct justice and began cooperating with prosecutors . <p/>He served five months in federal prison . <p/>He remained an ardent defender of Nixon , speaking out as recently as last year to assail Magruder's assertions in a PBS program that the president ordered the illegal entry and bugging at the Watergate . <p/>LaRue had experienced scandal and tragedy before he ever entered Nixon's inner circle . <p/>His father , Ike Parsons LaRue , had served jail time for banking violations . <p/>Later , in 1954 , he struck oil in Mississippi . <p/>Young Frederick worked in the oil field alongside other relatives for several years , until it was sold for a reported $30 million in 1967 . <p/>That same year he shot and killed his father in a hunting accident in Canada . <p/>Various reports suggest that the LaRues never had control of the oil fortune or that they squandered it in bad investments . <p/>When Frederick LaRue's name started appearing in newspapers in connection with the Watergate controversy , he told a reporter that he was \"no millionaire . \" <p/>The family wealth , however , established him as a power in Mississippi politics in the 1960s . <p/>He was a major contributor to Arizona Republican Sen . Barry Goldwater's failed 1964 presidential bid . <p/>In 1967 LaRue became a generous friend of the Nixon campaign . <p/>When the Republican National Convention came around the following year , he was a key Southern strategist in the Nixon election drive . <p/>In 1972 , after Mitchell resigned as attorney general to head the Committee to Re - Elect the President , known as CREEP , LaRue became a hard - core member of the \"Mitchell group\" at CREEP , along with Robert C . Mardian and Henry S . Fleming . <p/>He also worked closely with Magruder , the deputy campaign manager . <p/>They became so close that they were often referred to as one person , \"Magrue . \" <p/>LaRue was with Magruder , Mitchell and Mardian at a campaign stop in Los Angeles when the Watergate burglars were arrested , on June 17 , 1972 . <p/>G . Gordon Liddy , one of \"the plumbers\" - - the nickname for the clandestine White House operation that carried out the burglary - - phoned Magruder and LaRue during breakfast to break the news . <p/>Magruder took the call . <p/>\"He said , 'That's Gordon Liddy . <p/>He wants me to go out to some air base and talk on a secure phone , ' \" LaRue , recalling Magruder's words , told the Biloxi Sun Herald last year . <p/>\"I said , 'Go get the damned pay phone . <p/>That's just as good , and find out what he wants . ' \" <p/>According to Magruder's testimony before the Senate Watergate committee - - an account reportedly confirmed by LaRue - - he and LaRue worked in lock - step with Mitchell and Mardian from that day forward to concoct and maintain a coverup story . <p/>\"I joined in that coverup , at least by acquiescence , \" LaRue said in a statement after he admitted the government's charges against him . <p/>He also joined Mardian in destroying documents and financial records pertaining to the Watergate operation . <p/>Additionally , LaRue received more than $300 , 000 in cash , which he distributed to Watergate defendants and their lawyers . <p/>James W . McCord Jr . , one of the men arrested at the Watergate complex , said at the time that the money was paid to ensure that all the defendants would plead guilty and remain silent . <p/>Of the seven defendants , McCord and Liddy refused to plead guilty , but all were found guilty of conspiracy , burglary and wiretapping . <p/>Although the first to plead guilty in the coverup case , LaRue was the last defendant to be sentenced . <p/>He served most of a six - month sentence before returning to Mississippi . <p/>He was often mentioned as among those thought to be Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward's shadowy inside source , Deep Throat . <p/>Other candidates included Alexander Haig , Nixon's chief of staff and later President Reagan's secretary of State ; Earl J . Silbert , an original Watergate prosecutor ; and L . Patrick Gray , the acting FBI director , who lived near Woodward . <p/>LaRue denied the distinction , as did all the others , and conjectured that the legendary source was actually an amalgamation of figures close to the scandal . <p/>\"Who . . . would it have been ? \" he mused in an interview with a Biloxi reporter recently . <p/>\"There were not that many people who knew the inside and out of what was going on . <p/>I don't think it would have been Magruder . <p/>It wasn't me . \" <p/>Woodward , who said he would reveal Deep Throat's identity after the source died , could not be reached Wednesday .",

  "marked_doc": "Mark Felt , FBI official who became 'Deep Throat , ' dead at 95 <p/>W. Mark Felt , who was the No. 2 official at the FBI when he helped bring down President Richard M. Nixon by resisting the Watergate cover-up and becoming Deep Throat , the most famous anonymous source in <mark id=\"mark_id\"> American history </mark> , died on Thursday . <p/>He was 95 and lived in Santa Rosa . <p/>His death was confirmed by Rob Jones , his grandson . <p/>In 2005 , Felt revealed that he was the source who had secretly supplied Bob Woodward of The Washington Post with crucial leads in the Watergate affair in the early nineteen seventies . <p/>His decision to unmask himself , in an article in Vanity Fair , ended a guessing game that had gone on for more than 30 years . <p/>The disclosure even surprised Woodward and his partner on the Watergate story , Carl Bernstein . <p/>They had kept their promise not to reveal his identity until after his death . <p/>Indeed , Woodward was so scrupulous about shielding Felt that he did not introduce him to Bernstein until this year , 36 years after they cracked the scandal . <p/>The three met for two hours one afternoon in November in Santa Rosa , where Felt had retired . <p/>The reporters likened it to a family reunion . <p/>Felt played a dual role in Nixon 's downfall . <p/>As a secret informant , he kept the story alive in the press . <p/>As associate director of the FBI , he fought the president 's efforts to obstruct the FBI 's investigation of the Watergate break-in . <p/>Felt later said he believed that Nixon had been misusing the FBI for political advantage . <p/>He knew that Nixon wanted the Watergate affair to vanish . <p/>He knew that the White House had ordered the CIA to tell the bureau , on grounds of national security , to stand down in its felony investigation of the June 1972 break-in . <p/>He saw that order as an effort to obstruct justice , and he rejected it . <p/>That resistance led indirectly to Nixon 's resignation . <p/>Passed up for promotion <p/>Felt had expected to be named to succeed J. Edgar Hoover , who had run the bureau for 48 years and died in May 1972 . <p/>The president instead chose a politically loyal Justice Department official , L. Patrick Gray , who later followed orders from the White House to destroy documents in the case . <p/>The choice infuriated Felt . <p/>He later wrote that the president `` wanted a politician in J. Edgar Hoover 's position who would convert the bureau into an adjunct of the White House machine . '' <p/>Hoover had sworn off break-ins without warrants - `` black bag jobs , '' he called them - in 1966 , after carrying them out at the FBI for four decades . <p/>The Nixon White House hired its own operatives to steal information , plant eavesdropping equipment and hunt down the sources of leaks . <p/>The Watergate break-in took place six weeks after Hoover died . <p/>While Watergate was seething , Felt authorized nine illegal break-ins at the homes of friends and relatives of members of the Weather Underground , a violent left-wing splinter group . <p/>The people he chose as targets had committed no crimes . <p/>The FBI had no search warrants . <p/>He later said he ordered the break-ins because he felt national security required it . <p/>In a criminal trial , Felt was convicted in November 1980 of conspiring to violate the constitutional rights of Americans . <p/>Nixon , who had denounced him in private for leaking Watergate secrets , testified on his behalf . <p/>Called by the prosecution , he told the jury that presidents and by extension their officers had an inherent right to conduct illegal searches in the name of national security . <p/>`` As Deep Throat , Felt helped establish the principle that our highest government officials are subject to the Constitution and the laws of the land , '' the prosecutor , John W. Nields , wrote in The Washington Post in 2005 . <p/>`` Yet when it came to the Weather Underground bag jobs , he seems not to have been aware that this same principle applied to him . '' <p/>Seven months after the conviction , President Ronald Reagan pardoned Felt . <p/>Then 67 , Felt celebrated the decision as one of great symbolic value . <p/>`` This is going to be the biggest shot in the arm for the intelligence community for a long time , '' he said . <p/>After the pardon , Nixon sent him a congratulatory bottle of champagne . <p/>Felt then disappeared from public view for a quarter of a century , denying unequivocally , time and again , that he had been Deep Throat . <p/>It was a lie he told to serve what he believed to be a higher truth . <p/>William Mark Felt was born in Twin Falls , Idaho , on Aug. 17 , 1913 . <p/>After graduating from the University of Idaho , he was drawn to public service in Washington and went to work for Sen. James P. Pope , D-Idaho . <p/>In 1938 , he married his college sweetheart , Audrey Robinson , in Washington . <p/>They were wed by the chaplain of the House of Representatives . <p/>She died in 1984 . <p/>The couple had a daughter , Joan , and a son , Mark . <p/>They and four grandsons survive Felt . <p/>Days before Pearl Harbor , after earning a law degree in night classes at George Washington University , Felt applied to the FBI and joined it in January 1942 . <p/>He spent most of World War II hunting German spies . <p/>After stints in Seattle , New Orleans and Los Angeles , Hoover named him special agent in charge of the Salt Lake City and Kansas City offices in the late nineteen fifties . <p/>Rising to high positions at the headquarters in the 1960s , he oversaw the training of FBI agents and conducted internal investigations as chief of the inspection division . <p/>In early 1970 , while waiting in an anteroom of the West Wing of the White House , Felt chanced to meet a Navy lieutenant delivering classified messages to the National Security Council staff . <p/>The young man in dress blues was Bob Woodward . <p/>By his own description fiercely ambitious and in need of adult guidance , Woodward tried to wring career counseling from his elder . <p/>He left the White House with the number to Felt 's direct line at the FBI <p/>On July 1 , 1971 , Hoover promoted Felt to deputy associate director , the third in command at the headquarters , beneath Hoover 's right-hand man and longtime companion , Clyde A. Tolson . <p/>With both of his superiors in poor health , Felt increasingly took effective command of the daily work of the FBI . <p/>When Hoover died and Tolson retired , he saw his path to power cleared . <p/>But Nixon denied him , and he seethed with frustrated ambition in summer 1972 . <p/>Breaking Watergate <p/>One evening that summer , a few weeks after the Watergate break-in , Woodward , then a neophyte newspaperman , knocked on Felt 's door in pursuit of the story . <p/>Felt decided to cooperate with him and set up an elaborate system of espionage techniques for clandestine meetings with Woodward . <p/>If Woodward needed to talk , he would move a flowerpot planted with a red flag on the balcony of his apartment on P Street in Washington . <p/>If Felt had a message , Woodward 's home-delivered New York Times would arrive with an inked circle on Page 20 . <p/>Woodward would leave his apartment by the back alley that night and take one taxi to a downtown hotel , then a second to an underground parking garage in the Rosslyn section of Arlington , Virginia . <p/>Within weeks , Felt steered The Post to a story establishing that the Watergate break-in was part of `` a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage '' directed by the White House . <p/>For the next eight months , he did his best to keep the newspaper on the trail , largely by providing , on `` deep background , '' anonymous confirmation of facts reporters had gathered from others . <p/>The Post 's managing editor , Howard Simons , gave him his famous pseudonym , taken from the pornographic movie then in vogue . <p/>Millions of Americans knew him only as a shadowy figure in the 1976 movie made from the Watergate saga , `` All the President 's Men , '' which made `` Woodward and Bernstein '' legends of American journalism . <p/>In the movie , Deep Throat ( Hal Holbrook ) gives Woodward ( Robert Redford ) probably the most famous bit of free advice in the history of investigative journalism . <p/>It was a three-word road map to the heart of the matter : `` Follow the money . '' <p/>Felt never said it . <p/>It was part of the myth that surrounded Deep Throat .",

  "marked_doc": "http : / / www . examiner . com / article / chiefs - lose - 20 - 13 - to - colts - despite - charles - 226 - yards - rushing <p/>Chiefs <mark id=\"mark_id\"> lose </mark> 20 - 13 to Colts despite Charles \u2019 226 yards rushing <p/>December 23 , 2012 <p/>On a day when the Kansas City Chiefs rushed for the 3rd - most yards in franchise history and the defense played well for 55 minutes of the game , the Chiefs lost to the Indianapolis Colts , 20 - 13 , and kept their grip on the #1 pick in the 2013 NFL Draft . <p/>By beating the Chiefs , Indianapolis \u2019 record rose to 9 - 5 and they locked up a playoff spot just one season after posting the worst record in the NFL in 2011 \u2013 a Chiefs - like 2 - 14 mark . <p/>Meanwhile , the Chiefs lost their 13th game of the season and could tie the franchise mark of 14 losses next week in Denver against Peyton Manning and the Broncos . <p/>The 2008 Chiefs ended the season with a 2 - 14 record . <p/>On the only positive note for the game , the Chiefs had two players rush for over 100 yards apiece \u2013something that hasn \u2019 t happened to the franchise since 1991 . <p/>Jamaal Charles ( 226 yards ) and Peyton Hillis ( 101 yards ) led a powerful attack that , for any team other than the 2012 Chiefs , would have nearly guaranteed a victory . <p/>KC ended the game with 352 net yards rushing . <p/>The 1961 Dallas Texans rushed for 398 yards against Houston ( 10 / 1 / 61 ) and the \u2019 66 squad gained 380 yards rushing against Denver ( 10 / 23 / 66 ) . <p/>But this year \u2019 s team was undone again by three turnovers , a missed field goal , and untimely penalties that wiped out scoring drives . <p/>Brady Quinn threw two interceptions , both of which had a devastating effect on the Chiefs . <p/>The first occurred on Kansas City \u2019 s opening drive when Quinn threw behind receiver Dexter McCluster and Colts cornerback , Darius Butler , picked it off and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown , putting Indy up 7 - 0 . <p/>Quinn \u2019 s second interception of the game came at a crucial point in the 4th quarter with the team trailing 13 - 10 and with the ball at the Indy 14 - yard line . <p/>Quinn underthrew a pass in the end zone to receiver Jon Baldwin and was picked off by Vontae Davis for an Indianapolis touchback . <p/>Yet another potential scoring opportunity blown for the Chiefs . <p/>Quinn threw a third interception \u2013 and his second to Davis in consecutive series \u2013 but it was overturned when Davis was called for pass interference . <p/>Any honest Chiefs fan would say that it was the most \u201c phantom \u201d interference penalty ever as Davis never appeared to touch KC receiver Jamar Newsome . <p/>Kicker Ryan Succop showed his Jekyll / Hyde nature in the first quarter by nailing a 47 - yard field goal that looked good the moment he kicked it , but then missing a 43 - yarder that would have made the score 7 - 6 . <p/>Towards the end of the first half , Charles made his only mistake of the day by fumbling at the Indianapolis 16 - yard line , snuffing out another scoring opportunity with the Chiefs behind 10 - 3 . <p/>The Colts turned the fumble into another field goal and went into halftime leading KC , 13 - 3 . <p/>As the second half opened , the Chiefs looked like they were going to go into self - destruct mode again when return man , Devon Wylie , inexplicably tried to return the second - half kickoff from deep in his own end zone and was swarmed under at the 14 - yard line by Indy . <p/>The few Chiefs fans remaining in the stands undoubtedly thought about going home early and getting a head start on dinner . <p/>( Personal note : Somebody on the special teams \u2019 coaching staff needs to put leg chains on Wylie , who apparently thinks he is former All -

  "marked_doc": "Peyton Manning was nearly perfect , which was exactly what the Indianapolis Colts needed Thursday night to overcome the emotion the Jacksonville Jaguars showed with Richard Collier 's return . <p/>Analysis and discussion of the N.F.L. on the New York Times pro football blog . <p/>Manning threw for 364 yards and three touchdowns , helping the Colts secure the No. 5 seed in the American Football Conference <mark id=\"mark_id\"> playoffs </mark> with a 31-24 victory over the Jaguars in Jacksonville , Fla . <p/>Collier , a Jaguars tackle , was paralyzed below the waist after he was shot in early September . <p/>Manning completed his first 17 passes in leading the Colts to their eighth consecutive victory and seventh straight playoff berth . <p/>Indianapolis ( 11-4 ) took its first lead of the game when Keiwan Ratliff intercepted a pass from David Garrard and returned it 35 yards for a touchdown and a 31-24 lead with 4 minutes 48 seconds remaining . <p/>The Jaguars had two chances to tie the score , but both drives ended with sacks . <p/>Garrard drove Jacksonville to the 7-yard line with 29 seconds remaining , but Maurice Jones-Drew sprained his knee on a reception , and since the Jaguars had no timeouts , 10 seconds ran off . <p/>Garrard misfired on first down , then got sacked by Dwight Freeney to end the game . <p/>The Colts overcame a 14-0 deficit in the second quarter and a 24-14 deficit early in the fourth . <p/>They won without receiver Marvin Harrison ( hamstring ) , running back Joseph Addai ( shoulder ) and linebacker Gary Brackett ( leg ) . <p/>TWO MORE RAMS OUT St. Louis lost two more players for the rest of the season , placing wide receiver and kick returner Derek Stanley and linebacker Gary Stills on injured reserve . <p/>The moves brought to 12 the number of Rams players on injured reserve <p/>Stanley tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in Sunday 's loss to Seattle and was expected to be out six to eight months after surgery . <p/>Stills had been playing with bone chips in his left knee and was scheduled to have surgery on Friday . <p/>Offensive tackle Jonathan Scott was signed by Buffalo to fill the roster spot left open after defensive end Aaron Schobel was placed on injured reserve last week . <p/>Scott had six starts in 20 appearances over two seasons with the Lions . <p/>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo said he did not anticipate any problem being ready for the next game , even in a shortened week . <p/>Romo said he would be ready Saturday night when Dallas plays its Texas Stadium finale against the Baltimore Ravens . <p/>Running back Marion Barber did not practice Thursday and was considered a game-time decision , as he was a week ago when he had only 2 yards on 8 carries . <p/>Barber has been hampered by a broken pinkie toe that forced him to miss a game . <p/>Tarvaris Jackson has reclaimed his starting spot at quarterback for Minnesota . <p/>Coach Brad Childress said the decision has nothing to do with the health of Gus Frerotte and everything to do with the way Jackson has played the last two weeks . <p/>Jackson , who was benched after losses to Green Bay and Indianapolis to start the season , now finds himself leading the Vikings ( 9-5 ) into a crucial game with Atlanta on Sunday . <p/>A win would give the Vikings their first N.F.C. North title .",

Christ ! <p/>Still , to further illustrate to you , our well - informed readers , how running the football is nearly meaningless in this league , the Chiefs never led in this game despite running all over an extremely porous and injured Colts defense . <p/>Part of the reason KC ran so effectively was the awful play of Pat Angerer , how should so obviously be on IR right now it's not even funny . <p/>He redeemed himself a bit by forcing a critical fumble late in the second quarter , but that play was mostly the fumble - prone Jamaal Charles ( 3 on the season ) being careless with the ball . <p/>Still , despite three turnovers , KC managed to tie the game going itno the fourth . <p/>Then , as he has done so many times this year , Andrew Luck wielded his magic wand and willed the Colts to victory . <p/>The Colts offense went on a 13 - play drive starting at their own 27 , ate up 6 : 05 of the clock , and capped it off with a 7 - yard touchdown pass from Luck to ( who else ) Reggie Wayne . <p/>Ballgame . <p/>20 - 13 . <p/>Colts win . <p/>The Colts are the second team in NFL history to make the post - season the year after posting a 2 - 14 ( or worse ) record the year prior . <p/>Andrew Luck set an NFL record , throwing for 205 yards in the game , swelling his season yardage to 4 , 183 . <p/>Cam Newton in 2011 had the previous record with 4 , 051 yards . <p/>The guy who had it before Cam ? <p/>Peyton Manning in 1998 with 3 , 739 . <p/>Luck's fourth quarter drive was his 7th game - winning drive this season . <p/>That's both a rookie record and an NFL record . <p/>No QB has ever had seven game - winning drives in one year . <p/>Unbelievable . <p/>Dwayne Allen also got into the record books . <p/>He eclipsed Ken Dilger's franchise record for catches by a rookie tight end in one season . <p/>Allen had three catches on Sunday , bringing his season total to 43 . <p/>Dilger had 42 in 1995 . <p/>Dilger's quarterback that year ? <p/>Jim Harbaugh , the man who would go on to recruit Andrew Luck at Stanford before going to to coach the San Francisco 49ers . <p/>with the win in KC , coupled with the Steelers losing to the Bengals 13 - 10 , all the teams in the AFC playoffs are set . <p/>Also locked up is the No . 5 seed for the Colts . <p/>They will face the No . 4 seed , which could mean a trip to Baltimore to face the Ravens , the team Chuck Pagano used to coach for . <p/>Speaking of Pagano , he is scheduled to return to work full - time tomorrow as the head coach after taking a leave of absence to battle leukemia . <p/>His cancer is now in remission , and he returns to a team that is bound for the post - season . <p/>Wonderful story . <p/>Wonderful season . <p/>Couldn't ask for anything more . <p/>Well , except one thing . . . <p/>win in the playoffs ! <p/>Go Colts",

5 and in the playoffs as the AFC's five seed . <p/>It is the representation of an incredible sesaon that will be extended beyond just next week . <p/>The Colts got the win today , but it wasn't pretty . <p/>In fact , according to Pro Football Reference , it was the first time in NFL history that a team rushed for over 350 yards and lost the game . <p/>The Colts were outplayed on both sides of the ball , but when it counted Andrew Luck and the Colts got it done . <p/>Check out some notes from the game : <p/>Andrew Luck was terrible for a stretch in the game that included 10 straight incompletions . <p/>But after that he got hot at just the right time and hit his last 6 passes of the day , capped off by a 7 - yard touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne in the back of the end zone for what proved to be the game winning score with four minutes left . <p/>He ended the day 17 / 35 for 205 yards and the touchdown along with 6 carries for 21 yards . <p/>For the second week in a row he did not turn the ball over , which is huge . <p/>And he also set the NFL rookie record for most passing yards in a season with 4 , 051 yards - breaking Cam Newton's record set a year ago . <p/>Dwayne Allen also set a Colts rookie record for receptions by a tight end with 43 . <p/>Allen has had a tremendous rookie year . <p/>He has a bright future ahead of him . <p/>Cassius Vaughn and Pat Angerer both were terrible today . <p/>There were others as well , but those two were the ones that really stuck out . <p/>Basically , however , the whole defense stunk today . <p/>The Colts gave up 507 total yards , 352 of them on the ground . <p/>It was the worst run defense I have seen the Colts play since that now infamous debacle in Jacksonville in 2006 . <p/>Simply must improve . <p/>That said , the Colts won the turnover battle 3 - 0 over the Chiefs . <p/>Darius Butler picked off a terrible Brady Quinn throw and took it back 32 yards for a score . <p/>It was Butler's 4th pick of the year and the 2nd one he returned for a touchdown . <p/>Pat Angerer also forced a big fumble with the Chiefs in the red zone and threatening that led to 3 points for the Colts before the half . <p/>And then the 3rd turnover was a pick by Vontae Davis . <p/>When you have a +3 turnover differential , you are going to win most games . <p/>It will be huge if the Colts could keep that up . <p/>The wide receivers really didn't help out Andrew Luck today . <p/>They dropped several passes ( Reggie Wayne included ) and failed to get open numerous other times . <p/>While it looked like a bad game from Luck , I place more of the blame on the receivers in this one . <p/>Nothing was open . <p/>However , on the final drive , once Reggie Wayne started getting involved , the Colts started rolling . <p/>On the last drive he caught 3 passes for 37 yards and a touchdown . <p/>Prior to that he had caught 2 passes for 44 . <p/>The key was that once the Colts got Reggie involved , good things happened . <p/>This game was Andrew Luck's 7th game - winning drive of the season , tying an NFL record - not just a rookie record . <p/>Peyton Manning did it twice . <p/>Incredibly , if Luck leads a game winning drive next week in a very winnable game for the Colts , he would have the NFL record all to himself - as a rookie . <p/>Added to that fact is that the Colts are 8 - 1 in games decided by one score or less - the only loss coming in week 3 on that last - minute 80 yard touchdown pass by the Jaguars after Luck had led another go - ahead scoring drive late in the 4th quarter . <p/>Chuck Pagano returns tomorrow . <p/>What a moment that will be tomorrow when Pagano walks into the locker room and is handed the head coaching reigns once again . <p/>And what a moment that will be next Sunday when he takes the field for the first time since week 3 . <p/>Colts nation has supported him all the way , as has the NFL . <p/>Next Sunday , the division rival Houston Texans come to Lucas Oil Stadium having never won in Indy . <p/>This is a game that before the season I even thought the Colts would win - back when I thought they would get 7 wins all year . <p/>They can beat the Texans , and with Pagano coming back , that will be a special game . <p/>Great job , Bruce Arians . <p/>Tremendous . <p/>Now my piece of advice to the Colts - don't stop being Chuckstrong . <p/>Pagano certainly won't .",

Y . Hilton on third down and made two nice throws to Wayne before hitting the veteran in the back of the end zone . <p/>\"We had so many opportunities all game , especially on third down , that we squandered , \" Wayne said . <p/>\"We wanted to get that done . <p/>That was the opportune time to do it . \" <p/>Darius Butler returned an interception 32 yards for the Colts' other touchdown , helping them join the 2008 Miami Dolphins as the only teams to win at least 10 games after losing 14 or more the previous season . <p/>Most of those wins have come under Arians , who has filled in admirably while Chuck Pagano underwent treatment for leukemia . <p/>Pagano is expected to rejoin the Colts this week . <p/>\"Mission accomplished . <p/>That's all I can say , \" Arians said . <p/>\"Without getting emotional again , knowing that ( Pagano ) is going to be back Monday , the work week shouldn't be as stressful . \" <p/>Charles' big day included an 86 - yard touchdown run on the first play of the second half . <p/>It was his second 200 - yard game of the season , and came one week after he managed 10 yards on nine carries against Oakland . <p/>\"It was fun today , competing out there and doing it while we were trying to come back , \" Charles said . <p/>\"It was fun going out there and putting out a performance like that . \" <p/>Charles joined the Titans' Chris Johnson and former Lions great Barry Sanders as the only players with three runs of 80 or more yards in a season . <p/>His third career 200 - yard game also set a franchise record , which he had shared with Larry Johnson . <p/>Peyton Hillis added 101 yards on the ground for the Chiefs ( 2 - 13 ) , who had 352 yards rushing in a losing effort \u2013 the first time that's happened in NFL history . <p/>A big reason why was Quinn , who was just 10 of 22 for 162 yards with two interceptions . <p/>\"This game was without a doubt , 100 percent on my shoulders , \" he said . <p/>\"You can't play the way I played today and win a football game . \" <p/>His trouble began with the Chiefs' fifth offensive play , when he threw woefully behind Dexter McCluster \u2013 who wasn't even looking for the ball . <p/>Butler picked off the pass in stride , taking it untouched to the end zone for a 7 - 0 lead . <p/>Kansas City managed a field goal by Ryan Succop , but he missed his next try and the Colts went the other direction to set up the first of Adam Vinatieri's two field goals . <p/>Charles fumbled in the red zone later in the second quarter , and the Colts moved into Vinatieri's range for a 36 - yard field goal and a 13 - 3 halftime lead . <p/>Charles electrified a sparse crowd on the first play of the second half . <p/>He angled to the left and then found room down the sideline , cutting back toward the middle of the field and winning a foot - race with the Indianapolis defense for an 86 - yard touchdown run . <p/>The Chiefs were in position to take the lead later in the third quarter , but Quinn was picked off by Vontae Davis in the end zone . <p/>The defense forced a three - and - out and Kansas City was driving again before settling for Succop's tying 47 - yard field goal . <p/>The Chiefs got the ball back again late in the fourth quarter , but Quinn was stuffed on a quarterback sneak on fourth - and - inches from the Indianapolis 27 . <p/>That turned the ball over to Luck , who completed an 11 - yard pass to T . Y . Hilton to convert a third down before he and Wayne won it . <p/>\"At times it looked a little bleak , \" Arians said . <p/>\"Guys hung in there , made plays when they had to make them . <p/>Offensively we struggled , and then put together a drive , like we have all year . \" <p/>Notes : Chiefs WR Terrance Copper ( left knee ) and DT Tyson Jackson ( left foot ) left with injuries . . . . <p/>Wayne had five catches to become the fifth player in NFL history with four 100 - catch seasons . <p/>He also became the 14th player to reach 13 , 000 yards receiving .",

'' <p/>Interoute said the January incident brought down 70 percent of the Internet network in India and the Middle East . <p/>Customer services and some mobile-phone customers at Vodafone Group Plc 's Egyptian unit are affected by the cable failure , said Simon Gordon , a spokesman for the U.K. company . <p/>Egypt is the only country where the company is aware of any problems linked to the failure , he said . <p/>Most mobile-phone calls are routed through fixed-line cables at some point . <p/>Verizon Communications Inc. , the second-largest U.S. phone company , said it has rerouted traffic for its Verizon Business customers making calls to the Middle East by siphoning it to Europe and the U.S. and then down through Asia , spokeswoman Linda Laughlin said in an interview . <p/>The rerouting slowed some traffic to about half its normal speed , Laughlin said . <p/>Point-to-point customers still do n't have connections , and Verizon does n't have information on how many subscribers are affected . <p/>The company expects repairs to be completed by early next week , she said . <p/>Portugal Telecom SGPS SA , Portugal 's biggest phone company , has redirected traffic through other cables in the region and therefore the `` impact is very small , '' said a company official . <p/>Sonaecom SGPS SA , Portugal 's second-biggest fixed-line phone company , also said that it 's diverting traffic to other routes . <p/>France Telecom 's Orange mobile-phone unit said the cable failure `` greatly disturbed '' the traffic between Europe and parts of Asia . <p/>At one point as much as 55 percent of voice traffic in Saudi Arabia , 52 percent in Egypt and 82 percent in India was out of service , according to Orange . <p/>Internet traffic `` from Mumbai to London has now been rerouted via Hong Kong which may lead to congestion and increased latency on this route , '' <p/>Reliance said in an e-mailed `` traffic disruption update , '' adding that it is working with the affected customers to restore all services . <p/>The company said it will publish another update on its Web site tomorrow . <p/>`` You can reroute the data through other cables , but that increases traffic and can potentially create bottlenecks , '' Interoute 's Wright said . <p/>`` So Internet connections may slow down and some phone calls could get disrupted . '' <p/>Some of Interoute 's clients in the U.K. and Southern France are probably affected by the failure , Wright said . <p/>`` It 's difficult to forecast how long it will take to fix the problem as it depends on the weather and sea conditions in the Mediterranean , '' Wright said . <p/>A fault is affecting the SMW4 cable near the Alexandria cable station , the FLAG FEA cable is down and the SMW3 cable system is also affected , according to information received from Telstra . <p/>Flag Telecom Group Ltd. , a Reliance Globalcom unit , operates FLAG FEA and the other cables are owned by groups of phone companies across the regions . <p/>Reliance Globalcom does n't know exactly what happened and engineers are working on the problem , said Anurag Joshi , head of the company 's global network operations center . <p/>The SMW4 cable , also known as SEA-ME-WE 4or South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 4 cable network , connects 12 countries : Pakistan , Indonesia , Singapore , Malaysia , Bangladesh , India , Sri Lanka , United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Italy and France . <p/>France Telecom said one of its maintenance boats in the Mediterranean area is headed to the region for a relief mission with 20 kilometers of spare cable on board . <p/>Priority will be to recover the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable , then the SEA-ME-WE 3 cable , France Telecom said , adding that Sea Me We4 could be operating by Dec. 25 and the situation should be back to normal by Dec. 31 .",

<p/>Having nurtured his son 's talent and his competitive drive and his character and everything else along the way , history demanded he be in his seat , ready to stand and salute his son as he swallowed down the lump in his throat and expressed his love and thanks . <p/>Evansville proved the story 's perfect villain , keeping it close through the early stages , and giving an already charged-up crowd opportunity to boo lustily as the Purple Aces ' physical big men knocked Hansbrough to the ground on several occasions . <p/>Did n't they know that 's how Hansbrough would have wanted it -- physically challenged , and therefore determined to crush them into submission ? <p/>Ford , meanwhile , made a gentlemanly entrance , gracefully shook hands with fans of all ages , posed for pictures , and waited in the wings for history to arrive . <p/>After it did , he was pure class , thanking Roy Williams , Hansbrough , and the university for asking him to be a part of the night . <p/>`` It 's a dream come true for me , '' he said , sounding genuinely honored to be passing the torch to a player who , like him , gave his best for the program and properly understands that team success , not individual records , are the real measure of success . <p/>Even with the game underway and subject to unpredictable bounces , an official 's phantom call , or some other twist of fate , the script held . <p/>The first points came from the foul line , swishing through the basket without a doubt , as they have more often than for any other Carolina player before him . <p/>One reminder of greatness in the books . <p/>The next points rapidly followed on a series of jumpers , well beyond the range of anything doubters expected the brawling forward to hit on a regular basis when he was a freshman . <p/>`` I 'll prove you wrong , '' you could almost hear him thinking as he hit each one , showcasing the senior 's evolution into a complete player . <p/>Another reminder : players like this come along only once in a generation . <p/>Then there was the struggle , as teammates worked to get him the ball in scoring position . <p/>Having told everyone he wanted to break the record on a three , he camped out on the wing for one possession but failed to get a touch . <p/>On another , he posted hard inside as Danny Green took and missed an open three ; <p/>as the Heels ran to the other end , Williams appeared to holler at Green for failing to look inside first . <p/>On this night , with history looming , even good quality shots needed to wait for the moment . <p/>But the struggle was needed , too . <p/>Has n't that been the essence of Carolina 's working-class hero : the battler , scrapping for everything , finding success as much through passion as through athletic ability or skill ? <p/>It took will -- and a brief stint on the bench -- before the moment came . <p/>Then , sure as sure , it did . <p/>Because it did , a number of things will be quickly forgotten . <p/>Though Tywon Lawson had another dominant performance and Danny Green ( who broke a milestone of his own with his 1,000th career point ) showcased the increasingly confident game that makes his summer draft experiment seem less surprising , the Tar Heels grinded their way through a game with 16 turnovers -- two more than Evansville -- and only 17 assists . <p/>Deon Thompson never established a rhythm , taken out of his finesse game by the Purple Aces ' physical style . <p/>Early in the second half , Williams yanked out all five starters and replaced them with a Blue Team , unhappy with the focus and effort . <p/>And Wayne Ellington 's shooting slump continued , his normally perfect stroke disconcertingly slow to return from the finals break . <p/>It was another double-digit win , and against a quality mid-major opponent , but a work of art it was n't . <p/>Hansbrough , who looked as though he was pressing all night despite finishing with another 20-point , 9-rebound performance , admitted to the nerves . <p/>They were particularly evident on his next touch after the record-breaking points , when Hansbrough stole an inbounds pass , only to brick a dunk attempt off the back of the rim -- another moment that will probably be erased as history gives way to legend . <p/>`` I felt like there was a lot of pressure , '' he said . <p/>`` I did n't want to strictly focus on the scoring record . <p/>We had a game and I was trying to do whatever I could to help the team . <p/>Now I 'm glad it 's over , and I 'm ready to move on .

Slaughter and Orlando Mendez-Valdez . <p/>Three teams went into games on Thursday night trying to earn their first victories of the season . <p/>Congratulations are in order for North Florida , who beat Furman 77-66 . <p/>The other two teams were not as fortunate . <p/>North Carolina Central dropped to 0-13 after a 66-51 loss to Winstom-Salem and Texas Southern moved to 0-10 after absorbing a blowout loss to No. 9-ranked Gonzaga .",

ONE MORE YEAR ! ONE MORE YEAR ! \u201d <p/>Indeed . <p/>But for all of McDermott \u2019 s historic accomplishments and his game - high scoring output , the storyline from the CU side of things was the combined play of Gregory Echenique and Will Artino . <p/>Echenique hadn \u2019 t scored much in two games against Drake earlier this season : he put up just 2 points in a 30 - point CU win in Omaha , and then battled foul trouble all night in Des Moines as Drake upset CU . <p/>And he went scoreless in the first half Friday . <p/>But up stepped Artino , Echenique \u2019 s sub when the CU coaching staff goes in favor of size and a high / low game instead of Ethan Wragge \u2019 s shooting touch from deep . <p/>Friday afternoon , Artino gave the Bluejays 14 energized and efficient minutes . <p/>Entering February , he had played double - digit minutes in just six games . <p/>Since the calendar flipped from January , though , he \u2019 s had five such games . <p/>Friday was arguably his most important performance of the season , given the stakes . <p/>Artino checked in at the under - 16 : 00 media timeout and immediately broke a 12 - 12 tie with a dunk . <p/>Fouled on the flush , he finished the traditional three - point play with a free throw . <p/>Two trips later , Artino missed a shot but secured the follow and scored again . <p/>He would grab two more rebounds before checking out with 9 : 07 to play in the first half . <p/>While he was in , Creighton \u2019 s lead grew as great as 9 points . <p/>In 8 first - half minutes , the guy teammates and fans call Big Swag scored 7 points and ripped down 5 rebounds . <p/>He played the high - low possessions well . <p/>While Drake held Echenique scoreless in the first half , Artino was able to find success . <p/>He finished the day with a career - high 14 points and 6 rebounds ( 5 on the offensive glass ) . <p/>In the second half , though , Echenique got , um , engaged with things . <p/>He scored all 11 of his points , grabbed 6 of his team - high 11 rebounds , and swatted 5 of his season - high 6 blocked shots ( the 6 blocks are second - most in an MVC Tournament game ) . <p/>During the game \u2019 s deciding 15 - 2 run , Echenique scored two traditional three - point plays , grabbed 3 of his 11 rebounds , and blocked two shots . <p/>Hammered on a no - call and forced to play at a disadvantage based on inconsistent referring in the frontcourt , Echenique seemed fired up . <p/>He flexed a few times , too , so as to remind the Bulldogs who the alpha dog in the paint was on Friday afternoon . <p/>The tournament \u2019 s top seed sticks around for Semifinal Saturday . <p/>The 1998 Bradley Braves remains the only play - in winner to advance past the quarterfinals , when they beat a two - seeded Creighton team . <p/>Wichita State survived a close game against Missouri State Friday evening , and Illinois State broke away late from Northern Iowa to advance as the six - seed . <p/>The Valley will have four solid fan bases represented in the Scottrade Center Saturday afternoon , with white and blue and black and gold the predominant colors swirling around the lower bowl . <p/>The day sets up for some solid matchups : <p/>The last time the two teams played , Indiana State made Creighton look completely lost . <p/>A blacked out crowd in Terre Haute helped the Sycamores to a resounding win . <p/>Meanwhile , it took a Carmichael karate kick and other late - game miscues for Illinois State to practically hand over a win to Wichita State in Normal .",

  "marked_sentence": "Creighton's Doug McDermott returns for <mark id=\"mark_id\"> senior season </mark>",
  "marked_doc": "http : / / www . omaha . com / article / 20130425 / BLUEJAYS / 704259841 <p/>Creighton's Doug McDermott returns for <mark id=\"mark_id\"> senior season </mark> <p/>Doug McDermott \u2019 s teammates figured it was just another day in the gym Wednesday afternoon . <p/>They were playing pick - up games with a guy they didn \u2019 t know for sure would be around next season . <p/>But McDermott had a secret . <p/>Shortly before hitting the court , McDermott had told his father , Creighton coach Greg McDermott , that he intended to return for his senior season rather than declare for the NBA draft . <p/>Father and son then informed Creighton Athletic Director Bruce Rasmussen . <p/>Doug called his mom to break the news to her , then stepped into the gym to play a little ball . <p/>\u201c He wasn \u2019 t acting any different , \u201d Grant Gibbs said . <p/>\u201c Business as usual . \u201d <p/>Later that night , McDermott let the news slip to a couple of them . <p/>\u201c I had to go to class today , knowing that he was going to announce it , and try to be super low - key , \u201d Jahenns Manigat said . <p/>\u201c But I couldn \u2019 t stop smiling . \u201d <p/>It \u2019 s safe to assume Bluejay Nation had much the same reaction when , shortly before 2 p . m . , McDermott sent out the following message on Twitter : <p/>\u201c I will be returning to Creighton for my senior year and can \u2019 t wait to put on that uniform for one more season . \u201d <p/>McDermott \u2019 s return for his senior season will allow a fan base that has come to marvel at his on - court accomplishments the past three seasons one more chance to watch him . <p/>College basketball insiders see his return possibly giving Creighton more of a fighting chance as it moves into the new Big East . <p/>For McDermott , it will give him a chance to make more of an orderly transition from college basketball to professional basketball . <p/>He knows he \u2019 s taking a risk from a financial standpoint . <p/>\u201c That \u2019 s definitely a lot of money I \u2019 m passing down , but that money could be there next year , \u201d McDermott told reporters Thursday . <p/>\u201c It might not be quite as much , but you really can \u2019 t put a price tag on a senior year . \u201d <p/>That was the same theme that McDermott touched on repeatedly Wednesday night in an exclusive interview with The World - Herald . <p/>In the final analysis , McDermott \u2019 s heart won out over the cash . <p/>\u201c My heart has been telling me all along to stay , but my mind tried to take over a couple of times , \u201d McDermott said . <p/>\u201c I just ended up trusting myself that I was making the right decision . \u201d <p/>His mind , of course , focused on the financial benefits that might be his had he decided to turn professional . <p/>Based on evaluations he received from the NBA Draft Advisory Committee , McDermott said , \u201c There was no doubt in my mind that I would have been a first - round pick . \u201d <p/>That would have meant a two - year , guaranteed contract that could have been worth between a minimum of $888 , 600 to $1 . 4 million if he had been selected with one of the last 15 picks in the lower half of the first round . <p/>That initially had his father recommending that his son turn pro . <p/>\u201c He knew my dream is to play in the NBA , and he just felt that this was too good of an opportunity to pass up , \u201d Doug said . <p/>\u201c But the way I look at it , if I can play in the NBA , I can play there the next year just as well as I can next year . <p/>\u201c I feel there are things I can work on . <p/>I feel I can still improve my draft stock by playing in the Big East . <p/>There are a lot of areas that I can get better at , and I just felt I \u2019 d be more comfortable doing it here in Omaha . \u201d <p/>McDermott had heard more than once from outsiders that he should turn pro because he had nothing left to prove as a collegian . <p/>The 6 - foot - 8 , 225 - pound forward has been a consensus first - team All - American in each of the past two seasons . <p/>He broke Creighton \u2019 s career scoring record near the end of the last season . <p/>That argument might have swayed some players , but if there is anything McDermott has shown the past three seasons it \u2019 s that he \u2019 s an unconventional superstar . <p/>He remains as unassuming as the day he stepped on campus in June 2010 . <p/>He embraces the attention from an adoring fan base that some players might find stifling . <p/>It \u2019 s that fan base , McDermott said , that figured prominently into his decision . <p/>\u201c I care so much about Creighton , \u201d he said . <p/>\u201c There are a lot of people around here that believed in me . <p/>This whole fan base has been with me from the start . <p/>I felt like I owed them one more year . \u201d <p/>McDermott said the opportunity to play in the new conference became more of a factor as he got deeper into the decision - making process . <p/>He admitted had Creighton remained in the Missouri Valley it might have made it easier to turn pro . <p/>But the opportunity to play in the Big East , and perhaps prove a few people wrong , was too much to pass up . <p/>\u201c I feel there are a lot of people that don \u2019 t believe we can be successful in the Big East , \u201d McDermott said . <p/>\u201c If you ask anyone on our team , we feel that we \u2019 re going to be capable of doing some damage there . <p/>\u201c That played into my decision a lot . <p/>I care for the guys in this program and I care for the coaches . <p/>I wanted to do what I could to help make this transition a successful one . \u201d <p/>What didn \u2019 t factor into his decision , he said , was the fear that he would be leaving his dad in a tight spot had he bolted for the NBA . <p/>As Greg McDermott said Thursday , his son \u2019 s 23 points and eight rebounds a game will come in handy next season . <p/>But Doug said his father and Creighton would have been fine had he decided to leave . <p/>\u201c He never pushed for me to stay , \u201d Doug said . <p/>In an interview with The World - Herald on Tuesday , McDermott indicated he might remain undecided until Sunday \u2019 s deadline to declare for the draft . <p/>The agony of the decision - making process was apparent as he spoke . <p/>He clearly was undecided . <p/>In discussing his decision Wednesday night , McDermott said he never intended to take so long in making up his mind . <p/>\u201c I apologize for putting people through that , \u201d he said . <p/>In trying to make up his mind , McDermott said , he put his emotions to a test . <p/>He would go through one day with the idea in mind that he was headed for the NBA . <p/>The next day , he would approach things as if he would be returning to Creighton . <p/>\u201c I wanted to see how I felt , \u201d McDermott said . <p/>\u201c I found myself waking up the next day feeling a whole lot better when I was thinking about coming back . <p/>But I went back and forth more times than you can imagine . \u201d <p/>He said Tuesday that he had talked with former Creighton All - American Kyle Korver , now in his 10th season in the NBA . <p/>McDermott also sought the counsel of Harrison Barnes , his former teammate at Ames High School who now is wrapping up his rookie season with the Golden State Warriors . <p/>\u201c He and I talked before the NCAA tournament , and he told me I should go to the NBA if I felt I was 100 percent ready , \u201d McDermott said . <p/>\u201c That really stuck with me . <p/>\u201c Harrison told me that playing in the NBA is a completely different world . <p/>The money is nice , but you \u2019 re out there fighting for your job every night . <p/>It \u2019 s not like college , where you \u2019 re playing for the love of the game and for the fans . \u201d <p/>In the end , those factors appealed more to McDermott than money . <p/>\u201c I believe I \u2019 m going to play in the NBA , but I have to do it when I feel I \u2019 m 100 percent ready , \u201d he said . <p/>\u201c I feel like I have some unfinished business here at Creighton . <p/>I feel like I can be a lot better , and why not do it here where I can have fun for another year . <p/>\u201c I \u2019 m so relieved . <p/>I feel like a ton of weight has been lifted off my shoulders . <p/>I can \u2019 t put into words how happy I am this is behind me and how excited I am to be coming back . <p/>This just feels right . \u201d",

  "marked_sentence": "Still , given the century 's worth of <mark id=\"mark_id\"> tradition </mark> that has reigned in Chapel Hill , it was no small feat that Hansbrough accomplished Thursday night , when he broke Ford 's school career scoring mark with less than eight minutes to play in the first half of North Carolina 's game against Evansville",
  "marked_doc": "Hansbrough broke UNC 's career scoring record the Carolina way <p/>During the spring of 1977 , North Carolina coach Dean Smith invited his star guard Phil Ford , who had just completed his junior season , into his office . <p/>Smith told Ford that he had done some research on where Ford would be selected in the upcoming NBA draft.

Redick for the all-time ACC scoring record ( 2,769 points ) , has succeeded in just about every statistical category , though he is still searching for the elusive fifth national title for the program , which moved to 10-0 after its 91-73 drubbing of Evansville . <p/>Hansbrough finished the game with 20 points and nine rebounds .",

'' <p/>Such a query would be difficult thing to say `` no '' to , given all the media attention that the 10-year-old 's death and Timmons ' subsequent arrest brought . <p/>By 5:00pm Monday , selection was winding down for the day as five were already picked for the jury . <p/>Timmons remained at the courthouse along with defense attorney Peter Lynch and Albany County District Attorney Dave Rossi . <p/>`` The evidence in this case is gon na ' show factually that Jermayne is not the person who caused [ Thomas ' ] death , '' Lynch told local media Monday . <p/>However , Lynch has a tough job ahead of him in proving that his client did not pull the trigger and , in the end , kill Thomas . <p/>This , when police have released an alleged confession from Timmons , and a letter of apology that he is said to have written to the girl 's mother that reads , `` I am so sorry that the gun I shot is the gun that could have takeing ( sic . ) your baby girl away from you , '' <p/>King provided an explanation , saying , `` The so-called apology note was posed more in the question of if [ Timmons ] , in some way , could have been responsible , he would have been apologetic for it , '' <p/>None of Thomas ' family members were present in the courthouse Monday , only Timmons ' friends and relatives . <p/>Also absent were those who are expected to be called on as witnesses . <p/>In an unprecedented move , Albany County Assistant District Attorney Dave Rossi asked the media to keep the identities of certain witnesses quiet . <p/>`` If we start seeing names in the paper or on the news on day one , I think it 's gon na ' make it more difficult for us to have witnesses in the seat on day two , three and four , '' he said . <p/>One of the witnesses that can be talked about is Jermayne Timmons ' own mother , who is expected to take the stand . <p/>Jury selection will likely go on until sometime Tuesday . <p/>It was more than seven months ago when that errant bullet killed Kathina Thomas . <p/>The 10-year-old was shot on the night of May 29th while she was playing outside her First Street home . <p/>Less than two weeks later , Jermayne Timmons was arrested and charged with the shooting . <p/>It was discovered shortly after the arrest that Timmons had written an apology letter to the mother of Kathina Thomas , saying the bullet was not meant to hit the girl . <p/>In response to the fallout over Thomas ' death , and further gun violence in Albany , District Attorney David Soares announced a gun buyback program in mid-June , offering up gift cards to anyone who brought in a gun .",

  "marked_doc": "Pinup icon Bettie Page died Thursday evening at a hospital in Los Angeles after having suffered a <mark id=\"mark_id\"> heart attack </mark> on Dec. 2 and spending time on life support , according to her official site . <p/>Page was born on April 22 , 1923 , in Nashville , Tenn . <p/>She began modeling in 1950 when she met New York City police officer and photographer Jerry Tibbs . <p/>According to Page 's official website , by 1951 she was appearing in the men 's magazines Eyefull , Wink , Titter , and Beauty Parade . <p/>In 1955 , Hugh Hefner asked Page to pose in a Playboy centerfold , a move that would help her seal her popularity and financial security decades later . <p/>Page ended her modeling career in 1957 after turning to Christianity . <p/>Despite never posing in sexually explicit poses ( only nude photos ) , Page became an unwitting sex symbol and a face of the sexual revolution in the nineteen sixties . <p/>Her popularity rose again in the early 1990s but her insecurities kept her out of the spotlight . <p/>She wanted her fans to remember her as she was in her heyday . <p/>Adding to her bewilderment was the fact that this new popularity surge happened while Page was institutionalized in a Southern California mental facility after attacking a woman with a knife . <p/>When she was released in 1992 , she found herself in the spotlight again , thanks in part to a movie called The Rocketeer , which played off of pulp fiction characters of the 30s and 40s , including the image of Bettie Page . <p/>In spite of her renewed popularity , Page was n't receiving any royalty payments from her images . <p/>Page signed on with agent James Swanson , who in turn set her up with Curtis Management Group , who fought to get her the pay she deserved . <p/>Page came out of hiding in 2003 when she agreed to be photographed for Playboy . <p/>This was her last public photograph . <p/>Several biographies have been made , including her official biography Bettie Page: <p/>The Life of a Pin-up Legend , and a biography by Richard Foster called The Real Bettie Page: <p/>The Truth about the Queen of Pinup . <p/>A movie called `` The Notorious Bettie Page '' was released in 2005 , which told the pinup 's story between the 1930s and the nineteen fifties . <p/>Today , women still love to emulate her old-fashioned look , specifically her long black hair with bangs and red lipstick. Some people feel as if these women are unoriginal and failed to find an identity of their own , while others see this as the ultimate form of flattery . <p/>Page was survived by her sister Joyce Wallace of Georgia , and her brother Jack Page , who lives in Nashville , Tennessee .",

'' <p/>Ms Page disappeared for decades at the end of the Fifties , suffering serial broken marriages and devoting herself to Christianity . <p/>Even in her twilight years she suffered bouts of depression and ill health but was rediscovered in the late nineteen eighties . <p/>She would occasionally make public appearances to sign photographs of herself as popular interest in her suddenly took off again . <p/>To her astonishment , Ms Page has recently attained cult status . <p/>Madonna , Uma Thurman and Demi Moore are among contemporary stars who have at some time adopted Bettie Page poses , while in 2006 a movie , The Notorious Bettie Page , featured Gretchen Mol in the title role . <p/>Ms Page had been admitted to hospital originally for treatment for pneumonia and was set to be released and sent home on 2 December when she suffered her heart attack . <p/>A representative said she never recovered consciousness and died late on Thursday . <p/>`` She captured the imagination of a generation of men and women with her free spirit and unabashed sensuality , '' her agent , Mark Roesler , said yesterday . <p/>`` She is the embodiment of beauty . '' <p/>Even though she conceded to the occasional public event , she never agreed to having her photograph taken again . <p/>`` I do n't want to be photographed in my old age , '' she said in 1998 . <p/>`` I feel the same way with old movie stars . <p/>It makes me sad . <p/>We want to remember them when they were young . '' <p/>After her early career peaked , Ms Page became exhibit number one in a congressional hearing into so-called immoral activities in Washington . <p/>The controversy prompted her disappearance from public view . <p/>It was while living in Florida that she had her born-again experience and committed herself to the church and to the ministry of the Rev Billy Graham . <p/>In her later years , she defended the trade she pioneered . <p/>`` I never thought it was shameful . <p/>I felt normal . <p/>It was better than pounding a typewriter eight hours a day , which gets monotonous , '' she told Playboy in 1998 . <p/>As for being featured undressed , that seemed fine too . <p/>`` God approves of nudity , '' she said . <p/>`` Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden , they were naked as jaybirds .

'' <p/>Her photos included a centrefold in the January 1955 issue of the then fledgling Playboy magazine , as well as controversial sadomasochistic poses . <p/>The latter helped contribute to her mysterious disappearance from the public eye , which lasted for decades and included years during which she battled mental illness and became a born-again Christian . <p/>Playboy founder Hugh Hefner said: <p/>`` She was a remarkable lady , an iconic figure in pop culture who influenced sexuality , taste in fashion , someone who had a tremendous impact on our society . <p/>She was a very dear person . '' <p/>Roesler said Page had been in hospital for three weeks with pneumonia and was about to be released when she suffered the heart attack on December 2 . <p/>Her career began in October 1950 when she took a break from her job as a secretary in a New York office to take a walk along the beach at Coney Island . <p/>An amateur photographer named Jerry Tibbs admired the 27-year-old 's firm , curvy body and asked her to pose . <p/>Looking back on the career that followed , she told Playboy in 1998: <p/>`` I never thought it was shameful . <p/>I felt normal . <p/>It 's just that it was much better than pounding a typewriter eight hours a day . '' <p/>Nudity did n't bother her , she said , explaining: <p/>`` God approves of nudity . <p/>Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden , they were naked as jaybirds .

  "marked_doc": "Bettie Page , one of entertainment 's original sex kittens , the 1950s pin-up queen who many credit with having paved the way for the sexual revolution of the following decade , <mark id=\"mark_id\"> passed away </mark> Thursday , December 11 , at age 85 . <p/>Bettie Page died Thursday of pneumonia at a Los Angeles area hospital , longtime agent Mark Roesler said . <p/>She had suffered a heart attack earlier in December and never regained consciousness . <p/>He said he and Page 's family agreed to take her off life support . <p/>Roesler described her as `` the embodiment of beauty , '' and enthused that she `` captured the imagination of a generation of men and women with her free spirit and unabashed sensuality . '' <p/>Bettie Page 's signature raven-black long hair , her bangs , the red lipstick , her full , seductively rounded body and her provocative poses made her into a bona fide pin-up queen in the nineteen fifties . <p/>Her fame endured throughout the decades , even after she retreated from the spotlight and struggled with mental illness , moved around the country and became a born-again Christian . <p/>She was born Betty Mae Page on April 22 , 1923 in Nashville , Tennessee , in an impoverished family with six children . <p/>Despite being confronted with an abusive father who eventually went to prison and having to live in orphanages at times , Page grew up a great fan of Hollywood movies and was successful in school , as salutatorian of her high school graduating class . <p/>Her classmates voted her `` Most Likely to Succeed . '' <p/>She received an arts degree with Peabody College in Nashville and started modeling in the 1940s after moving to San Francisco with her first husband . <p/>They divorced in 1947 and Page continued her modeling work in New York . <p/>As chance would have it , photos from a shoot with Miami photographer Bunny Yeager ended up in the pages of Playboy . <p/>This would forever change Page 's life , as she became on of the two-year-old magazine 's first centerfolds in the January 1955 issue . <p/>Kneeling before a Christmas tree , wearing a Santa hat and a playful wink ( and that 's all ) and holding a Christmas tree ornament , Playboy founder Hugh Hefner described the layout as `` a milestone in the history of the magazine . '' <p/>A few years later , Page modeled in bondage and sadomasochistic poses . <p/>This caused great controversy , as the photographs were criticized by some as perversion and a congressional investigation was launched into pornography . <p/>By the late 1950s , Bettie Page had virtually disappeared from the public eye , having retreated to focus on her own personal life . <p/>She became a born-again Christian and worked for Billy Graham 's ministry , among others . <p/>She married two more times yet both unions failed . <p/>Beginning with the 1970s , she battled mental illness and was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic . <p/>During her retreat from the spotlight , Page was completely oblivious of the fascination she had ignited in the public . <p/>She made a comeback almost two decades later , signing memorabilia at conventions and occasionally granted interviews . <p/>She refused to have her photograph taken . <p/>Page had no children . <p/>A private funeral service will be held Tuesday , Dec. 16 , at Westwood Memorial Cemetery .",

  "marked_doc": "Chris Weitz is in negotiations to <mark id=\"mark_id\"> helm </mark> `` New Moon , '' the sequel to Summit Entertainment 's vampire breakout `` Twilight . '' <p/>Weitz comes on board to helm the second installment in Stephenie Meyer 's four-book series after Summit and `` Twilight '' director Catherine Hardwicke failed to reach a deal on the new movie . <p/>The Weitz move prompted a carefully calibrated campaign of reassurance on the part of creators . <p/>Meyer penned a letter that sought to calm fans nervous about the midstream switch . <p/>`` I 'm sad that Catherine is not continuing on with us for 'New Moon , ' she wrote in a letter on her Web site , but then noted that , with Weitz: <p/>`` Torches and pitchforks are n't going to be necessary . '' <p/>The director `` is excited by the story and eager to keep the movie as close to the book as possible , '' she wrote . <p/>`` He is also aware of you , the fans , and wants to keep you all extremely happy . <p/>It 's rare for the director of a successful first picture not to continue on with the sequel . <p/>There have been conflicting reports about Hardwicke 's departure , with some noting creative and other differences . <p/>Summit has said it was a matter of scheduling . <p/>Weitz has not helmed a girl-oriented project before but has been involved in movies that encompass elements featured in `` Twilight , '' producing the teen-aimed coming-of-age tale `` American Pie '' and directing the fantasy adventure `` The Golden Compass . '' <p/>Still , the director was taking few chances . <p/>`` I promise to remain responsive to your hopes and fears , '' he wrote in his own letter to fans Saturday . <p/>`` I thank you for this opportunity and for your faith . '' <p/>Weitz said he had been `` in a whirlwind romance '' with the series over the past few days , and , in a particularly careful phrasing , said he is `` very grateful to have received ( Meyer 's ) permission to protect 'New Moon ' in its translation from the page to the screen . '' <p/>Both Weitz 's and Meyer 's letters represent rare attempts to communicate with fans on issues often left mostly to the industry , and speak both to the intense insider interest of fans as well as the importance of that group to the franchise 's success . <p/>Summit a week ago had faced a public-relations challenge when some fan bulletin boards began to worry about Hardwicke 's departure . <p/>Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart will star in `` Moon , '' while Melissa Rosenberg is writing the picture which , like the first , centers on the ordinary teenager Bella and the vampire Edward but adds Jacob , a werewolf character who figured less prominently in the first film . <p/>The budget for `` Moon '' is expected to be slightly higher than the first in the franchise , with a release likely for late 2009 or early 2010 .",

  "marked_doc": "http : / / collider . com / hunger - games - catching - fire - gary - ross - release - date / <p/>Director Gary Ross Still in Negotiations for HUNGER GAMES Sequel , CATCHING FIRE ; Release Date May Be in <mark id=\"mark_id\"> Jeopardy </mark> <p/>Posted 1 year , 160 days ago [ downloaded on 2 October 2013 ] <p/>As I said many times in my review , Gary Ross \u2018 direction was the strongest element of The Hunger Games . <p/>But for Lionsgate , the movie \u2019 s ability to make a crazy amount of money was the strongest element of The Hunger Games . <p/>Now , THR is reporting that Ross and the studio are locked in tense negotiations over his return to direct the sequel , Catching Fire . <p/>Lead actors Jennifer Lawrence , Josh Hutcherson , and Liam Hemsworth are already signed for Catching Fire ( and I imaging they \u2019 re also signed for the third installment , Mockingjay ) , but Ross doesn \u2019 t have a deal in place . <p/>He was paid $3 million for co - writing and directing the film plus 5 percent on the back - end . <p/>Unsurprisingly , he would like a raise on the sequel . <p/>Hit the jump for more including why Catching Fire might not make its November 22 , 2013 release date . <p/>According to THR , negotiations on the first film were tough because Ross already had a successful , Oscar - nominated movie to his name ( Seabiscuit ) , but Lionsgate had never paid a hefty filmmaker salary before ( Hunger Games was the highest - budgeted project in the studio \u2019 s history ) . <p/>Now that Hunger Games will undoubtedly be one of the highest - grossing films of the year , Ross has some leverage , but current franchise trends aren \u2019 t moving in his favor . <p/>Other major franchises have shown no hesitation in constantly switching out directors . <p/>After all , it \u2019 s the title that draws people into the theaters , not the filmmaker . <p/>Harry Potter went through four directors as did Twilight , and Marvel has basically made it a policy never to rehire any of their directors . <p/>The studio \u2019 s highest priority is making sure to keep the franchise flowing without delay , and prolonged negotiations with Ross may cause a delay . <p/>There \u2019 s also the added problem of Ross taking time to revise Simon Beaufoy \u2018 s script for Catching Fire . <p/>Lionsgate is also facing an issue with the sequel \u2019 s scheduled November 22 , 2013 release date . <p/>Fox could stymie Lionsgate \u2019 s plans by exercising Lawrence \u2019 s option to do the sequel for X - Men : First Class . <p/>Sources tell THR that Fox \u2019 s option would take priority over Lionsgate \u2019 s . <p/>Lionsgate is aiming to get Catching Fire into production by the fall , but Fox already has their director ready to go ( Matthew Vaughn is signed to return for First Class 2 ) . <p/>However , First Class 2 doesn \u2019 t have a release date . <p/>Ross \u2019 does have a few counters against Lionsgate . <p/>First , he \u2019 s a known quantity and has established a relationship with the cast and crew . <p/>He also delivered a critically well - received movie . <p/>Granted , The Hunger Games would have crushed at the box office no matter what , but the positive response indicates that he \u2019 s now in higher demand for other properties . <p/>It \u2019 s an impressive boost for a director who hadn \u2019 t helmed a project since Seabiscuit in 2003 . <p/>Despite the acrimony , a source tells THR that the two sides will eventually make a deal : <p/>Ultimately , it will be difficult , and yet everybody will do the sane thing , which is to work it out , \u201d says one . <p/>\u201c Everybody will end up unhappy in their own way . <p/>It \u2019 s just the nature of the beast . \u201d <p/>The alternative is to throw 24 directors into an arena and have them fight to the death . <p/>And if you \u2019 re having trouble imagining other directors taking over the franchise , take a look at these fake posters for The Hunger Games .",

  "marked_doc": "The last five days have been a wild rollercoaster ride for `` Twilight '' fans , as the film 's director was told her services would no longer be required for the sequels , fueling speculation over her replacement , followed by a rumor about a supposed successor . <p/>Now , it seems , a battle is going on between a studio saying there 's no news to report and an entertainment magazine claiming Chris Weitz is <mark id=\"mark_id\"> getting behind the `` Twilight '' steering wheel </mark> . <p/>`` There will be a new director atop the 'Twilight ' franchise : and he 'll be a man , '' Entertainment Weekly 's `` Hollywood Insider '' is reporting . <p/>`` Sources tell EW.com that Summit Entertainment is about to hire Chris Weitz ( 'The Golden Compass ' ) as the shepherd for 'New Moon , ' the second installment of Stephenie Meyer 's best-selling 'Twilight ' series . '' <p/>Although Weitz was indeed offered the high-profile gig , the `` American Pie '' filmmaker has spent much of the week contemplating his participation . <p/>According to `` Twilight '' studio Summit Entertainment , the deal remains unconsummated . <p/>`` No , it is not official , '' a studio representative told MTV News on Thursday evening ( December 11 ) . <p/>`` We are not confirming anything at this point . <p/>He is not signed on as the director . '' <p/>`` We are not confirming , '' echoed a second representative . <p/>Whether EW is hearing incorrectly from their sources or the studio is just biding time until it can make a proper announcement , this much seems certain : Catherine Hardwicke is moving on to future projects that will not involve teenage vampires , and a man is likely to take her place . <p/>Twilighters have spent much of the week arguing with each other - and attempting to form protests and letter-writing campaigns - while debating whether they should speak out against the changes to their beloved franchise . <p/>Whether they 'll warm to Weitz is anyone 's guess , but at least the filmmaker can always take solace in the fact that the fanbase similarly rebelled against Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson when they originally signed up for the film that would make them superstars .",

Is there anyone on the way up who has that skill set ? <p/>I just don't see it , and I've grown tired of tuning in for passionless exhibitions of superiority . <p/>I don't think they've killed the division , I just think they've dominated it , and with no actual hope for that earth - shaking upset on the horizon , I think I'd personally prefer to just see them both take farewell fights and head on out . <p/>There's nothing more to see here .",

  "marked_doc": "http : / / www . eastsideboxing . com / weblog / news . php ? p=32688&more=1 <p/>Article posted on 08 . 07 . 2012 <p/>Wladimir Klitschko stops Tony Thompson in 6 with efficient <mark id=\"mark_id\"> execution </mark> <p/>Heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko once again displayed his dominance by scoring a sixth round stoppage against American contender Tony Thompson . <p/>Klitschko utilized good ring smarts and superior punching power to systematically break Thompson down . <p/>The first round started cautiously with both fighters becoming reacquainted with each other in a tentative feeling out process . <p/>Tony was exhibiting his trademark awkward movement and Wladimir was measuring him with the left rangefinder . <p/>It was a relatively even round without much action , but Klitschko landed the two best shots of the round even if Tony threw a little more . <p/>Thompson tried jumping on Wladimir to start the second but the champion was prepared . <p/>Klitschko followed this with a nice right hand followed by a short crisp combination . <p/>Later in the round another Klitschko right snuck in , and then a series of big rights backed the challenger into the ropes . <p/>Thompson was wrestled down to the canvas a couple of times in this stanza , and Wlad \u2019 s superior strength was evident . <p/>Klitschko was patient and measured , and his approach was paying off in round two . <p/>In between rounds Hall of Fame trainer Emanuel Steward told Klitschko he was mentally wearing Thompson down with pressure , and this certainly appeared to be the case . <p/>In round three Klitschko was again using his left hand to block jabs and establish range . <p/>Klitschko was looking almost exclusively for right hands , and was not using the authoritative jab we are accustomed to seeing because of Thompson \u2019 s awkwardness . <p/>Thompson was throwing jabs that were mostly being blocked or missing the mark . <p/>While it was obvious Thompson was having success in neutralizing Wlad's jab , he was also being peppered with Klitschko right hands that were inflicting far more damage than anything Thompson was throwing . <p/>Wladimir finally landed a solid jab almost halfway through the round , but his right hand was still the story of the fight . <p/>Thompson landed a decent left later in the round , but Klitschko was too elusive for him for the most part . <p/>It was another clear round for the champion . <p/>The fourth round was more of the same . <p/>The action was highlighted by a thudding right and a well timed combination from the champion . <p/>Before the start of the fifth , Steward urged Wladimir to throw more jabs and to spend less time waiting in between attacks . <p/>As has been the case many times in the past , Klitschko responded to Steward \u2019 s instructions and executed with workmanlike precision . <p/>He started landing the jab more , and this enabled him to score with a booming right hand that sent Thompson crashing to the canvas . <p/>Tony rose to his feet and the action resumed with about 20 seconds left . <p/>The challenger held on to survive , but this was perhaps the beginning of the end . <p/>Thompson came out to start the sixth and seemed to have regained his equilibrium . <p/>He was bouncing around , reacting to Klitschko \u2019 s feints , and mostly retreating in a defensive posture . <p/>As the round progressed he was trying to fling the jab out , but Klitschko was slowly measuring him up , cool as an assassin . <p/>Klitschko began throwing the infrequent jab and landing more big rights . <p/>Thompson was trying his best to survive , but then a vicious two - handed assault sent Thompson down for the second time . <p/>To his credit , he managed to rise to his feet , but the referee then waved it off . <p/>This was Klitschko \u2019 s second victory over Thompson , and with it he improves to 58 - 3 with 51 wins coming by way of knockout . <p/>Slowly but surely , Wladimir Klitschko is beginning to establish a strong legacy for himself . <p/>He may not always have the most crowd pleasing style , but he is intelligent , powerful , consistent , and extremely efficient at executing his game plan . <p/>The EPIX broadcast of the match made note of the following all - time heavyweight records in title fights : <p/>HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE FIGHTS <p/>Joe Louis 26 - 1 <p/>Muhammad Ali 22 - 3 <p/>Larry Holmes 21 - 5 <p/>Wladimir Klitschko 19 - 2 <p/>Lennox Lewis 15 - 2 - 1 <p/>Now of course this includes Klitschko \u2019 s title reign as WBO champion as well as his current reign which began when he captured the IBF strap from Chris Byrd . <p/>Many critics will note that the WBO was not universally recognized in high regard at the time Klitschko held that title . <p/>Even still , however , Klitschko has won 16 fights in a row since losing to Lamon Brewster in April 2004 , and he was won 13 title fights in a row since his April 2006 victory over Byrd . <p/>Beyond that , he has rarely lost a round during that impressive stretch . <p/>Given the current state of the heavyweight landscape , it is not inconceivable that Klitschko may well top that list before all is said and done .",

\" as they attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding Parliament and chased ceremonial guards away from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building . <p/>Tear gas drifted across the city center as rioters hurled paving stones and fire bombs at police . <p/>Firefighters extinguished blazes at least two buildings the bank and a branch of the Finance Ministry while protesters set up burning barricades and torched cars and a fire truck . <p/>Police said 12 people were injured in the riots . <p/>The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services , and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff . <p/>The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed and journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts . <p/>But media later broke the strike to report on the deaths and the protests . <p/>Violence also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center and some youths smashed store windows . <p/>Union reaction over austerity measures until now had been relatively muted by Greece's volatile standards , despite several previous strikes . <p/>But anger mounted after Papandreou announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants and another round of consumer tax increases . <p/>Papandreou said he has no choice but to implement the measures if Greece was to avoid bankruptcy . <p/>\"There was only one other solution for the country to default , taking the citizenry with it . <p/>And that would not have affected the rich , it would have affected workers and pensioners , \" he told Parliament on Wednesday . <p/>\"That was a real possibility , however nightmarish . \" <p/>Under the bailout package , Greece will receive loans over three years from the IMF and the other 15 countries who share the euro currency . <p/>The rescue aims to prevent Athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the euro . <p/>But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year . <p/>Even with the bailout , many economists think Greece will eventually default on or restructure its debts because its prospects for economic growth are so poor over the next several years , hurting government revenue . <p/>Some fear the austerity measures insisted upon by the EU and IMF could make prospects for growth even worse . <p/>Unions say low - income Greeks will suffer disproportionately from the latest austerity measures , which aim to save euro30 billion ( $40 billion ) the country's current budget deficit through 2012 . <p/>\"These people are losing their rights , they are losing their future , \" said Yiannis Panagopoulos , head of GSEE , one of the two largest unions . <p/>\"The country cannot surrender without a fight . \" <p/>IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn warned that the crisis could spread to other countries despite the rescue package's efforts to contain it . <p/>\"Everyone must remain extremely vigilant\" to this risk , Strauss - Kahn said in an interview in French newspaper Le Parisien Wednesday . <p/>\"I completely understand the Greek population's anger , its incomprehension at the size of the economic catastrophe , \" Strauss - Kahn said . <p/>But , he said , Greeks must also understand that without these measures \"the situation would be infinitely more serious . \" <p/>The draft bill of the new austerity measures is to be voted on Thursday . <p/>Papandreou's Socialists hold a comfortable majority of 160 in the 300 - seat Parliament and the bill is expected to pass easily .",

  "marked_doc": "With just over a month remaining <mark id=\"mark_id\"> in office </mark> , the Bush administration loosened federal protection of plant and animal species threatened with extinction . <p/>On Thursday , the Interior Department announced a change to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act , which required federal agencies to consult with scientists at the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service to determine whether a project is likely to affect any listed species . <p/>Under the new rule , federal agencies such as the Federal Highway Administration can in many cases simply check with their own personnel to determine if their activities will harm any of the 1,247 animal and 747 plant species listed as endangered or threatened . <p/>`` The rule strengthens the regulations so the government can focus on protecting endangered species as it strives to rebuild the American economy , '' said Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne . <p/>It started with the polar bears <p/>The rule change has its origins in a May announcement by the Interior Department that listed the polar bear as threatened because global warming is melting its habitat . <p/>It was the first animal to be listed because of climate change . <p/>In that announcement , Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said that even though global climate change is the reason that the bear is on the endangered species list in the first place , that list is `` not the means , nor the method , nor the vehicle by which you can deal with global climate change . '' <p/>The Interior Department 's press release cites a May editorial from the Washington Post that endorses this view: <p/>That Mr. Kempthorne has to contort his agency to ensure that it does n't get dragged into setting US climate policy is simply more proof of the need for such a policy , supported by the White House and ratified by Congress , that aims at sharply reducing greenhouse-gas emissions . <p/>Though the polar bear deserves protection , the Endangered Species Act is not the means and the Fish and Wildlife Service is not the agency to arrest global warming . <p/>The release quotes the second sentence of that paragraph . <p/>So under the new rules , federal agencies that are undertaking a project need not check with Fish and Wildlife or National Marine Fisheries under these circumstances: <p/>Where the action has no effect on a listed species or critical habitat , or <p/>Where the action is wholly beneficial , or <p/>Where the effects of the action can not be measured or detected in a manner that permits meaningful evaluation using the best available science , or <p/>Where the effects of the action are the result of global processes and can not be reliably predicted or measured on the scale of species current range , or would result in an insignificant impact to a listed species , or are such that the potential risk of harm to a species is remote . <p/>Reactions <p/>Environmentalists are less than thrilled by this rule change . <p/>Andrew Wetzler , director of the Natural Resources Defense Council 's Endangered Species Program , says his organization will probably sue: <p/>`` This administration has rejected anything with a whiff of science <p/>so before sulking out the back door , they are going after rules that require Fish and Wildlife Service scientists to prevent harm to our last wild animals and places . <p/>Despite today 's feel-good statements , we remain convinced that these changes are illegal . <p/>We will look at the final language when it is published tomorrow , but I think we will see them in court . '' <p/>Defenders of the Wildlife , who have filed suit along with Greenpeace and the Center for Biological Diversity , are similarly disgusted by the Bush administration 's actions: <p/>`` This administration 's disdain for wildlife and the environment has never been more clear than it is today , '' said Jamie Rappaport Clark , executive vice president of Defenders of Wildlife and former director of the Fish and Wildlife Service . <p/>`` For 35 years , the Endangered Species Act has helped save and recover imperiled wildlife on the brink of extinction . <p/>Now , with this administration facing its last days , they are doing everything they can to cement their anti-environmental legacy before the Obama administration takes office . '' <p/>The US Chamber of Commerce welcomed the rule change . <p/>Reversible ? <p/>Obama says that he intends to reverse the rule change , along with other `` midnight rules '' made in the waning days of the Bush presidency . <p/>But that may be easier said than done . <p/>ProPublica , a nonprofit investigative news organization , notes that while last-minute rules that have not yet taken effect can be quickly reversed by Obama 's appointees or by executive order , rules that are in force when he takes office can not : <p/>Rescinding a rule would require the new administration to restart the rulemaking process , which can take years and prompt legal challenges . <p/>Another strategy that has been talked about lately - getting Congress to disapprove the rules through the Congressional Review Act - carries political risks and has been used only once before . <p/>The new endangered species rule takes effect nine days before Obama 's inauguration . <p/>There is still a chance that the rule could be quickly reversed , however . <p/>USA Today reports that Rep. Nick Rahall ( D ) of West Virginia , the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee , says that he will likely invoke the Congressional Review Act , a rarely used law that gives Congress 60 days to review and overrule regulations issued by government agencies .",

  "marked_doc": "The Interior Department yesterday finalized rules changing the way it administers the Endangered Species Act , enabling other government agencies to decide on their own whether a project would harm an imperiled species without an independent <mark id=\"mark_id\"> scientific review </mark> . <p/>Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne called the move `` a clarification '' he considered essential in order to narrow the law 's reach . <p/>`` The rule strengthens the regulations so the government can focus on protecting endangered species as it strives to rebuild the American economy , '' Kempthorne said , adding that agencies can bypass a review by either the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration only `` in specific and limited instances where an action is not anticipated to harass , harm or kill a protected species . '' <p/>Dale Hall , who directs the Fish and Wildlife Service , said the change did not mean that agencies could build dams , roads or other projects without taking into account the consequences . <p/>`` The agency still has the full responsibility to make that decision and to defend that decision , '' Hall said , noting that the loss of an imperiled species , known as `` take , '' carries legal penalties . <p/>`` They 're still liable for take , if take occurs . '' <p/>Hall said he was initially concerned about `` the compressed time frame '' in which the agency pushed through the rule change , which was unveiled in August , but he added that he did n't `` see any harm '' in Kempthorne 's final decision . <p/>Interior went ahead with the rule change one day after the Environmental Protection Agency dropped two other controversial rules changes , saying they had come along too late in President Bush 's term. White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the reason was that the administration had `` publicly and clearly stated our intention '' to enact the endangered species measure well before a self-imposed deadline on eleventh-hour rule changes . <p/>The agency received nearly 235,000 comments on the endangered species proposal , at least 208,000 of which were form letters decrying the rule . <p/>Congressional Democrats and environmentalists sharply criticized the administration for the Interior Department action . <p/>`` As the Bush administration fades off into the sunset , it continues to take brazen pot shots at everything in sight , including America 's landmark conservation law , the Endangered Species Act , '' said House Resources Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall II ( D-W.Va. ) , who said he would introduce legislation seeking to overturn the rule next year . <p/>Separately yesterday , Interior issued a finding limiting the protections that could be invoked to protect polar bears , which were listed as a threatened species this year , on the grounds that the bears are already protected under the Marine Mammals Protection Act . <p/>The finding means that the bears ' protected status could not be used to block activities such as oil and gas development outside their Alaska habitat . <p/>`` We do not believe the science is there to make the causal link between activities in the lower 48 to the take of a polar bear , '' Kempthorne said . <p/>`` To finally admit that the science compels the listing of the polar bear as threatened due to global warming , but then deny it the protections the Endangered Species Act should provide , is nothing other than irresponsible and shameful , '' said Jamie Rappaport Clark , executive vice president of the advocacy group Defenders of Wildlife , adding that her group would sue to overturn the rule .",

  "marked_doc": "http : / / www . ucsusa . org / news / press _ release / endangered - species - letter - 0227 . html <p/>April 27 , 2009   <p/>Biologists <mark id=\"mark_id\"> Call on </mark> Obama Administration to Overturn Bush Rules that Cut Science Out of Endangered Species Legislation <p/>Interior and Commerce Secretaries Must Act by May 9 <p/>More than 1 , 300 federal and independent scientists with biological expertise and three leading scientific societies today called on the Interior and Commerce departments to overturn rule changes made in January that weaken the scientific foundation of the Endangered Species Act . <p/>In a letter , the scientists urged the department secretaries to rescind changes to Endangered Species Act regulations that allow federal agencies to decide for themselves if their own projects\u2014such as roads , dams and mines\u2014would threaten imperiled species . <p/>Previously , federal agencies were required to consult with biologists at the U .

  "marked_doc": "Just six weeks before President-elect Barack Obama <mark id=\"mark_id\"> takes office </mark> , the Bush administration issued revised endangered species regulations Thursday to reduce the input of federal scientists and to block the law from being used to fight global warming <p/>The changes , which will go into effect in about 30 days , were completed in just four months . <p/>But they could take Obama much longer to reverse . <p/>They will eliminate some of the mandatory , independent reviews that government scientists have performed for 35 years on dams , power plants , timber sales and other projects , a step that developers and other federal agencies have blamed for delays and cost increases . <p/>The rules also prohibit federal agencies from evaluating the effect on endangered species and the places they live from a project 's contribution to increased global warming . <p/>Interior Department officials described the changes as `` narrow , '' but admitted that the regulations were controversial inside the agency . <p/>Environmentalists viewed them as eroding the protections for endangered species . <p/>Interior officials said federal agencies could still seek the expertise of federal wildlife biologists on a voluntary basis , and that other parts of the law will ensure that species are protected . <p/>`` Nothing in this regulation relieves a federal agency of its responsibilities to ensure that species are not harmed , '' said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne in a conference call with reporters . <p/>Current rules require biologists in the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to sign off on projects even when it is determined that they are not likely to harm species . <p/>The rule finalized Thursday would do away with that requirement , reducing the number of consultations so that the government 's experts can focus on cases that pose the greatest harm to wildlife , officials said . <p/>But environmentalists said that the rule changes would put decisions about endangered species into the hands of agencies with a vested interest in advancing a project and with little expertise about wildlife . <p/>Several environmental groups filed a lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco hours after the rule 's announcement . <p/>Jamie Rappaport Clark , a former director of the Fish and Wildlife Service and a vice president of Defenders of Wildlife , said Thursday that the changes target the `` absolute heart of the Endangered Species Act . '' <p/>Clark told a House hearing on the Bush administration 's last-minute environmental regulations that these changes remove `` a system of checks and balances that provides an essential safety net for imperiled animals and plants . '' <p/>Between 1998 and 2002 , the Fish and Wildlife Service conducted 300,000 consultations . <p/>The National Marine Fisheries Service , which evaluates projects affecting marine species , conducts about 1,300 reviews each year . <p/>The reviews have helped safeguard protected species such as bald eagles , Florida panthers and whooping cranes . <p/>A federal government handbook from 1998 described the consultations as `` some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species . '' <p/>The Bush administration worked diligently to get the change in place before Obama took over , corralling 15 experts in Washington in October to sort through 250,000 written comments from the public on the revisions in 32 hours . <p/>Obama has said he would work to reverse the changes . <p/>But because the rule takes effect before he is sworn in , he would have to restart the lengthy rulemaking process . <p/>House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rep. Nick Rahall , D-W.Va. , said he would seek to overturn the regulations using the Congressional Review Act after consulting with other Democratic leaders . <p/>The rarely used law allows Congress to review new federal regulations . <p/>Congress has opposed similar changes to the endangered species protections in the past . <p/>In 2003 , the Bush administration imposed similar rules that would have allowed agencies to approve new pesticides and wildfire reduction projects without seeking the opinion of government scientists . <p/>The pesticide rule was later overturned in court . <p/>The Interior Department , along with the Forest Service , is currently being sued over the rule governing wildfire prevention . <p/>In 2005 , the House passed a bill that would have made similar changes to the Endangered Species Act , but the bill died in the Senate . <p/>Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe , the leading Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , said in a statement the new regulations were `` common-sense changes to a law much overdue for reform . '' <p/>There are a handful of other environmental regulations still pending before Bush leaves office , including a rule to exempt large agricultural operations from reporting releases of ammonia and other hazardous air pollutants . <p/>They must be finalized by Dec. 19 in order for them go into effect before Jan. 20 . <p/>In a related development , the Interior Department also finalized Thursday a special rule for the polar bear , a species that was listed as threatened in May because of global warming . <p/>The rule would allow oil and gas exploration in areas where the bears live , as long as the companies comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act .",

  "marked_doc": "The Bush administration on Thursday eliminated 35-year-old regulations in the Endangered Species Act that required an independent scientific <mark id=\"mark_id\"> review </mark> of proposed federal projects to determine whether they imperil protected plants and animals . <p/>Instead , federal agencies undertaking projects like road and power plant construction or oil and gas drilling will make their own assessment . <p/>Without the independent reviews , such projects could be accelerated . <p/>As part of the changes announced by Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne in the final days of the Bush administration , the department finalized an interim rule that allows oil and gas drilling in polar bear habitat off Alaska 's coast . <p/>The rule change is designed to prevent the Endangered Species Act from being used to regulate greenhouse gas emissions , essentially making climate change policy . <p/>Kempthorne , who characterized the new rules as a common-sense streamlining of bureaucratic processes , acknowledged that there was disagreement within the department regarding the rules , which take effect in 30 days . <p/>Under current law , agencies must submit any plans that could harm species on the endangered list for review by scientists at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , which enforces the Endangered Species Act . <p/>The process has been criticized by home builders groups and the oil and gas industry for delaying costly projects . <p/>The consultation requirement was intended as more than just a check and balance . <p/>Jamie Rappaport Clark , executive vice president of Defenders of Wildlife and director of Fish and Wildlife under President Clinton , said the consultation process resolved the problem of `` mission conflict '' between agencies . <p/>The Department of Defense , for example , might not understand why an endangered plant should be considered when expanding a bombing range . <p/>`` The problem is the agencies do n't always properly consider , understand or protect species in their habitat because they are focused on the pursuit of their primary mission , '' Clark said . <p/>`` It 's hard for the biologists to satisfy their responsibility to protect species if the agency perceives it affects their primary mission . '' <p/>President-elect Barack Obama said he would reverse the rule changes , as have some members of Congress . <p/>But that requires a lengthy rule-making process . <p/>In the House , members can invoke the rarely used Congressional Review Act to overturn the regulations . <p/>`` These changes are going to result in more species being put in jeopardy , '' Clark said . <p/>`` But more importantly , we are not going to know what we do n't know anymore . '' <p/>Officials said agencies would still be held liable if they approved projects that harmed threatened or endangered species . <p/>Kempthorne also noted that any federal agency could choose to informally consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service at any time . <p/>H. Dale Hall , director of Fish and Wildlife , said he had concerns about how fast the estimated 235,000 public comments were processed . <p/>Staff assigned to the job spent eight hours a day tabulating the comments . <p/>Working under strict time restraints , agency employees had nine seconds to read each letter , according to one calculation . <p/>Officials said that more than 200,000 of the comments opposed the rule change . <p/>Attempts to revise the Endangered Species Act have been rebuffed by Congress in recent years . <p/>Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) said Thursday 's actions were another assault on the law . <p/>`` These midnight regulations are part of a continuing effort by the Bush administration to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door and weaken protections for our nation 's endangered species , '' she said in a statement . <p/>`` I believe they are illegal , and if similar regulations had been in place , they would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle , the grizzly bear and the gray whale , '' Boxer said . <p/>Environmental groups , which took the administration to court to force it to list the polar bear , vowed to continue the legal battle . <p/>Three groups , the Center for Biological Diversity , Greenpeace and Defenders of Wildlife , filed suit in San Francisco hours after the changes were announced , arguing that the regulations failed to follow the public review process . <p/>`` The Bush administration has repackaged the same old lump of coal as a holiday present for the polar bear , and once again handed its friends in the oil industry a huge gift , '' said Kassie Siegel , climate program director at the Center for Biological Diversity and lead author of the 2005 petition to list polar bears . <p/>`` These regulations seem designed to drive the polar bear extinct . '' <p/>The rule regarding polar bears comes seven months after that animal became the first to be placed on the Endangered Species List primarily because of global climate change . <p/>The melting of sea ice is threatening the polar bear with extinction . <p/>This summer , scores of polar bears were observed swimming in open seas , far from land or ice floes . <p/>But Kempthorne said that he would n't allow the 1973 law to be used as a `` back door for implementing climate-change policy . '' <p/>To that end , he clarified regulations addressing threats to polar bear habitat : greenhouse emissions from automobiles , power plants and other human activities . <p/>The act requires federal agencies to designate habitat critical to the creature 's survival , then protect it by strict enforcement . <p/>Kempthorne said that according to his reading , court rulings require pinpointing a specific source of a threat to habitat -- something that he said was scientifically impossible . <p/>That interpretation of the courts ' opinions gives the government few options to protect polar bear habitat .",

Bush left office , he passed legislation that would have allowed federal agencies to skip consultations before launching projects that could affect endangered wildlife . <p/>This could have put more animals at risk , and while it would have eliminated a lot of red tape in the process , it could have been more risky to endangered animals than necessary . <p/>The problem with the legislation by Bush was that it was taking scientists out of the equation , and basically removing the most knowledgeable people from the equation . <p/>It would have given a lot of additional power to federal agencies , but stripped a lot of the rights that the Endangered Species Act gives to the animals which it seeks to protect . <p/>While the act is not perfect in its implementation or enforcement , undermining by removing any \"teeth\" that it might have was a big step in the wrong direction . <p/>President Obama has already received immense support from environmentalists for this move , and by overturning something the Bush administration put in place , he showed that he is also willing to step up to the plate on issues such as these . <p/>By flat out declaring that it is necessary to ensure that no harm will come to endangered species as the result of new projects , it gives the Endangered Species Act more strength , and does a lot to further the cause of environmentalists looking to protect these animals . <p/>With scientists being put back into the equation , it gives a lot of hope that the threatened wildlife will stand a better chance at surviving over the long term . <p/>It was a questionable move when Bush made the move to approve the last - minute legislation during his second term , and while there were a lot of objections , nothing could really be done at the time . <p/>With an eye toward the future , President Obama made a really smart decision by bringing scientists back into the endangered species fold , and surely helped to save a number of animals that could have otherwise been put at risk .",
